# Whitney Reservoir

Whitney Reservoir is located in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest, in Utah. From the Mirror Lake Highway take the Whitney Road exit and head 7 miles west to the Reservoir. The exit to Whitney Road is just southwest of the Christmas Meadows Area. The dirt road is in pretty good shape. Last time we were there cars, and minivans had no issue with the road.

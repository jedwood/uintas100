# Echo Lake

## Directions:
Echo Lake also known as Z-16 is located in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest in Utah. From the Mirror Lake highway take the Murdock Basin exit. Follow the Murdock Basin Road (road 137) to the lake. There are signs leading all the way up to Echo Lake although most people miss them and drive past the lake. I recommend you take a GPS. The first quarter mile of the road is paved after that the road will open up to a flat area that has a large map. Study the map before you drive up. The road looks like a old river bed and has lots of large rocks in it. Use a 4 wheel drive vehicle with lots of clearance. I broke the ball joint on my truck the last time I drove up there.

## Fish Species:
Brook Trout, Golden Trout

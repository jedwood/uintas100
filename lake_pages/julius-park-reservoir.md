# Julius Park Reservoir

Julius Park Reservoir is located in Uintah County, Utah and is part of the south slope of the Uinta Mountains. From Lapoint head north about 7 miles, take the left fork then follow the road about 15 miles.

Rainbow Trout and Brook Trout.

The reservoir is ran by the Mosby Irrigation Company. In the late fall the spillway is opened up all the way. This results in very little water being left in the lake over the winter. Due to the low water level, fish are not stocked here. Although plenty of fish get washed down river and end up in the reservoir.

The Mosby Canal flows into the reservoir. Mosby branches off from the Dry Fork River which originates from Deadman Lake.

# Cutthroat Lake

Cutthroat Lake also known as BR-37 is located in Summit County and is part of the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. The lake is located a little more than a mile west of Ruth Lake.

Cutthroat Trout, and Tiger Trout.

The quickest way to the lake is to hike to Ruth Lake, then head north west of Hayden Lake and hike towards Jewel Lake. You can hike around and up the mountain past Hayden but its rocky and more steep then the area around Jewel Lake. From this area you pretty much head west. There isn't really a trail around this area so a GPS will help immensely. From what I saw the lake looked deeper around the south west bank.

You can also access the lake from the Lofty Lake Loop Trail, although it is twice the distance.

5 acres, elevation 10,400 feet, maximum depth 16 feet, average depth 13 feet. A half mile south of Teal. A heart-shaped lake in a rugged setting. No direct trail to the lake. Some open shoreline for fly fishing. Good campsites with horse feed. Plenty of running water. Wary cutthroat and rainbow trout. Stocked with cutthroat trout.

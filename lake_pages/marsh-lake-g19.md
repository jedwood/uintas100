## Directions
Marsh Lake G-19 is located in Summit County, Utah. The lake lies within the Wasatch-Cache National Forest, and is part of the Smith Fork Drainage.

From Salt Lake City the fastest route is to take I80 highway to Fort Bridger, Wyoming. Head south to Mountain View and take the road WY-410 for 24 miles south. Stateline Reservoir is a around 2 miles before Marsh Lake G19 on the same road.

Alternatively you can enter from Mirror Lake Highway. Near the Bear River Campground take Forest Road 58 east for 19 miles. Take the turn off to Forest Road 073 and follow it east for a little over 16 miles. This is a dirt road which is usually decent enough to take a car on in the summer time.

## Fish Species
Marsh Lake G-19 is stocked with around 5,000 rainbow trout a year. In the 1980's, and 1990's, the lake was stocked with albino rainbow trout. Up until the early 1980's, the lake was stocked with brook trout. The lake can experience winter kills.

Marsh Lake is stocked with rainbow and albino rainbow catchables on a regular basis during the summer months. Stocking of brook trout fingerling ha been presently discontinued due to winterkil1 problems. The Forest Service has installed a water circulator at Marsh in an attempt to increase oxygen concentrations and improve winter survival of fish.

### Utah 2000 Lake Report
The Utah Division of Water Quality put out a report on the lake in the year 2000. In the report they incorrectly claim that Marsh Lake was treated with Rotenone in 1954. The lake that was treated for rough fish using Rotenone in 1954 was located in Sevier County, and not in the Uintas.

## Nearby Places To Fish
East Fork Smiths Fork river runs just to the west of Marsh Lake G-19. There is a beaver pond a half mile north of Marsh called G-30 which was stocked with brook trout in the 1960's. In the 1980's the DWR claimed that G-30 didn't sustain life and no longer stocked it. G-29 is another beaver pond which is located west of the turn off to Bridger Lake. G-29 was also stocked by with brook trout in the 1960's and then later ceased. Bridger Lake is located 2.5 miles to north west. Bridger is stocked frequently with brook and rainbow. Stateline Reservoir is located about a mile to the north. China Lake is located south west of marsh and can be accessed by hiking from the trailhead at china meadows. China Lake is stocked with brook trout and arctic grayling. The graying from china lake are known to swim up the Smith Fork river near marsh.

In typical Uintas fashion there is another lake named Marsh. This is why they designate the drainage and lake number to avoid confusion. In the Ashley Creek drainage there is Marsh Lake GR-39. This lake is stocked with golden trout, rainbow trout and brook trout. GR-39 had the Utah state record for golden trout in 2019.

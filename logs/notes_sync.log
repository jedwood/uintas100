<div>Report from Dave Webb way back in 2005: “<i>There's a nice meadow at the southern end of the lake and good fly fishing in the shallows in the mornings and evenings. Alligator has brook and cutthroat trout. The cutts are stocked. We caught only cutthroat, ranging up to 13 inches. I think there are bigger fish in the reservoir. We saw them cruising the shallows…Because thick trees grow right up to the water's edge, it was somewhat difficult to fish with a fly rod except in the meadow area. I tangled a lot of tippets in trees.”</i><br></div>

<div>Alligator is an elongated natural lake located in dense lodgepole forest at the lower end of the Henrys Fork Basin. The lake is 14.5 acres, 10,033 feet in elevation, with 26-foot maximum depth. Alligator experiences a minor water level fluctuation of 1-2 feet annually. The lake is situated 3/8 mile west of the Henrys Fork Trail on an unmarked side trail which begins some 2 1/4 miles southwest of the Henrys Fork Trailhead. Good campsites are available with a small amount of horse feed to the west. Spring water is not present and thick timber makes fly casting difficult. Due to the ease of access, Alligator is fished heavily. Remember to apply minimum impact camping techniques and carry out your refuse.</div>

<div>G-49 is a small narrow lake which abuts a steep talus shoulder of Red Castle Peak in the East Fork Smiths Fork Basin. This lake is 3.9 acres maximum, 10,830 feet in elevation, with 11-foot maximum depth. G-49 is subject to natural water level fluctuation of 7-8 vertical feet which in turn reduces the size of this lake to only 30 percent of maximum area by late summer. G-49 is located 100 yards east of the East Fork Smiths Fork Trail from the stream crossing 1/2 mile south of Lower Red Castle Lake. G-49 is located on the major drainage system between Red Castle and Lower Red Castle lakes. Good campsites and horse feed can be located in the general area, but spring water is not available. This small fluctuating lake contains a varied population of brook, cutthroat and rainbow trout which is able to overwinter in the small minimum pool and adjacent drainage system. G-49 receives light angling pressure and is often overlooked by anglers.</div>

<div>G-49 is a small narrow lake which abuts a steep talus shoulder of Red Castle Peak in the East Fork Smiths Fork Basin. This lake is 3.9 acres maximum, 10,830 feet in elevation, with 11-foot maximum depth. G-49 is subject to natural water level fluctuation of 7-8 vertical feet which in turn reduces the size of this lake to only 30 percent of maximum area by late summer. G-49 is located 100 yards east of the East Fork Smiths Fork Trail from the stream crossing 1/2 mile south of Lower Red Castle Lake. G-49 is located on the major drainage system between Red Castle and Lower Red Castle lakes. Good campsites and horse feed can be located in the general area, but spring water is not available. This small fluctuating lake contains a varied population of brook, cutthroat and rainbow trout which is able to overwinter in the small minimum pool and adjacent drainage system. G-49 receives light angling pressure and is often overlooked by anglers.</div>

<div>Report from Dave Webb way back in 2005: “<i>There's a nice meadow at the southern end of the lake and good fly fishing in the shallows in the mornings and evenings. Alligator has brook and cutthroat trout. The cutts are stocked. We caught only cutthroat, ranging up to 13 inches. I think there are bigger fish in the reservoir. We saw them cruising the shallows…Because thick trees grow right up to the water's edge, it was somewhat difficult to fish with a fly rod except in the meadow area.

<div>Alligator is an elongated natural lake located in dense lodgepole forest at the lower end of the Henrys Fork Basin. The lake is 14.5 acres, 10,033 feet in elevation, with 26-foot maximum depth. Alligator experiences a minor water level fluctuation of 1-2 feet annually. The lake is situated 3/8 mile west of the Henrys Fork Trail on an unmarked side trail which begins some 2 1/4 miles southwest of the Henrys Fork Trailhead. Good campsites are available with a small amount of horse feed to the west. Spring water is not present and thick timber makes fly casting difficult. Due to the ease of access, Alligator is fished heavily. Remember to apply minimum impact camping techniques and carry out your refuse.</div>

ANSON, LOWER, GR-9
Located at the end of the maintained trail into Weyman Lakes Basin, Lower Anson Lake is impossible to miss. Total distance from Spirit Lake and the Beaver Creek Trail head are 6.2 and 8.1 miles, respectively. The lake is 14.5 acres, 10,575 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 20 feet. Good campsites are infrequent in rough, rocky terrain. The best spots are in the vicinity of the trail. Horse feed is spotty. If you plan an extended trip, it is probably a good idea to pasture horses in the meadows along the stream between Lower and Upper Anson lakes. There is no spring water at Lower Anson, but there is a large spring on the east side of the creek about 0.1 mile north of Upper Anson Lake. Lower Anson Lake has been stocked in the past with brook trout. Due to apparent success of natural reproduction, stocking of brook trout was discontinued. Fishing pressure is moderate to heavy on this fairly popular water. A few cutthroat trout are also available.

ANSON, UPPER, GR-10
Upper Anson is a natural lake just 0.2 miles south of Lower Anson Lake in the Weyman Lakes Basin. A maintained Forest Service trail drops down from higher country to Lower Anson. From there a faint trail leads south along the east side of the creek to Upper Anson. Total distance from the Beaver Creek Trail head and Spirit Lake is 8.8 and 6.9 miles, respectively. Upper Anson Lake is 7.7 acres, 10,660 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 58 feet. Horses can travel within 100 yards of the lake but no further due to rocky terrain. There are no good campsites at the lake itself, however spring water is available. Campsites, horse feed and additional spring water are found between Upper and Lower Anson lakes. Upper Anson Lake contains a population of brook trout which sustains itself through natural reproduction. Fishing pressure is moderate.

BUMMER, GR-22
This small, shallow lake is located on the east side of Lamb Lakes Basin approximately 6.5 miles from Browne Lake. There is no maintained trail for the last 1.5 miles. The most direct access to lakes in this basin is cross-country from the junction of Forest Service trails 018-1 and 017 southwest up the bottom of the basin. The going is rough through rocky timber and across boulder fields. Horse access is impossible by this route and should not be attempted. Supposedly, horses can get into Lamb Lakes Basin via two little-used trails, one which drops from the ridge southeast of Bummer Lake, the other which drops from the ridge northwest of Ewe Lake. The existence of these trails was not verified during this project. Horse use in Lamb Lakes Basin would be restricted due to the rocky terrain. Bummer Lake is 1.9 acres, 10,350 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 6 feet. Wading can be an effective way to fish this lake. Use extreme caution, however, because footing is quite treacherous. The lake is periodically stocked with brook trout. Good campsites are rare, and there is no spring water. A little horse feed is found near the inlet. Fishing pressure is light.

CANDY, GR-17
Candy Lake is a rocky 5.5 acre pond lying in the northeast corner of Weyman Lakes Basin approximately 8.8 miles from the Beaver Creek Trail head. Follow the directions to Hidden Lake (GR-7). Candy lies 0.2 miles north through rocky timber. Horses can be taken as far as Lower Anson Lake. Candy Lake sits at an elevation of 10,290 feet and has a maximum depth of 29 feet. Campsites are rare in the immediate vicinity, but spring water is present. The lake does not overwinter fish due to poor inlet flows, and stocking has been discontinued indefinitely. The lake may be experimentally planted sometime in the future with Arctic grayling which may prove more tolerant of the harsh environment. Check with the Division of Wildlife Resources Office in Vernal for the current management of this lake.

CLEAR, GR-12
This pretty lake is aptly named. Located in Weyman Lakes Basin, Clear Lake lies 0.4 miles west of Lower Anson Lake, 8.5 miles from the Beaver Creek Trail head and 6.6 miles from Spirit Lake. The last 0.4 miles is through rocky timber, and horse access is impossible beyond Anson lakes. The lake is 10.2 acres, 10,780 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 25 feet. No campsites or spring water are found in the immediate area. Fishing pressure is light. The lake may contain cutthroat trout.

COLUMBINE, GR-116
Columbine Lake sits on a rocky bench at the base of a talus slope 1.3 miles southwest of Spirit Lake. The lake is 5.7 acres and 10,550 feet in elevation. Follow the Middle Fork of Sheep Creek upstream from Spirit Lake until the stream goes underground. The lake lies across the boulder fields to the south. Horse access is impossible. Spring water is available at the lake, and a few campsites can be found in a grassy area on the lake's southwestern shore. Despite only a 5 foot maximum depth and a lake level that tends to fluctuate during drier years, Columbine Lake still manages to support a small population of brook trout maintained through periodic stocking. Fishing pressure is light.

DAGGETT, GR-6
Located only 2.6 miles southeast of Spirit Lake via a good trail, Daggett Lake is one of the more accessible and popular lakes in the Sheep Creek drainage. It is 42.6 acres, 10,462 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 29 feet. Campsites are scattered around the lake. Spring water, although present, is not abundant. Horse feed can be found in a narrow meadow north of the lake or along the outlet below the dam. Daggett Lake is noted for hordes of mosquitoes that can quickly turn a pleasant hike into a real ordeal. Come prepared with lots of insect repellant. Fishing pressure is heavy for stocked rainbow trout. An occasional cutthroat can also be taken.

EWE, GR-18
Ewe Lake is located at the bottom of a talus slope in western Lamb Lake Basin. It is 3.0 acres, 10,750 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 10 feet. Ewe Lake is 7.3 miles from Browne Lake. The last 2.3 miles is cross-country across rough terrain. See Bummer Lake for a more detailed description of general access to the Lamb Lakes area. Campsites are scarce, but spring water can be found at the lake. Trout stocked in Ewe Lake in the past have not been able to overwinter, and as of 1986 the lake is fishless. Grayling may be introduced in the future on an experimental basis. Fishing pressure is light.

GAIL, GR-115
Gail is a small, seldom visited lake which sits at the bottom of a rock slide approximately 1.1 miles southwest of Spirit Lake. Follow the trail to Jesson Lake. Gail lies 0.2 miles to the south across downed timber and rocky terrain. The lake is 4.5 acres, 10,420 feet in elevation with 25 feet maximum depth. There are no campsites in this rough country, and spring water is not available. Horse access is difficult, if not impossible. Gail supports a small population of cutthroat trout. An occasional brook trout may also be taken. Fishing pressure is very light.

GR-11
This 2.6 acre pothole lake sits 200 yards southwest of Upper Anson Lake. Campsites, horse feed and sources of spring water are as described for Anson Lakes. GR-11 is 10,635 feet in elevation and has a maximum depth of 8 feet. This lake provides only marginal fish habitat and may winterkill. Fishing pressure is quite light for stocked brook trout.

GR-13
This natural moraine lake is situated on a glacial shelf at the bottom of a cirque in western Weyman Lakes Basin. The east-west orientation of the cirque makes this 9.2 acre lake susceptible to severe winds. GR-13 is located at timberline at an elevation of 10,820 feet and is surrounded by boulder fields and weathered stands of sub-alpine fir. The lake lies 0.7 miles west of Anson Lakes up rock slides and across rough boulder fields. Total distance from Spirit Lake and Beaver Creek Trail head is 7.8 and 9.7 miles, respectively. Horses are best left at Anson Lakes. Campsites are nonexistent, and no spring water is available. GR-13 is rather unique in that the lakes underground outlet is a visible siphon found along the northeastern shore. Fishing pressure is very light for stocked brook trout.

GR-14
This lake does not support fish life. It is shown on the map as a landmark.

GR-20
GR-20 is a fairly shallow, rocky pond which sits a short distance southwest of Bummer Lake in Lamb Lakes Basin. This lake is 5.7 acres, 10,355 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 8 feet. Access and camping are as described for Bummer Lake. The inlets and outlet of GR-20 are intermittent, and the lake provides only marginal fish habitat. Fishing is very light for stocked brook trout.

GR-21
Located less than 200 yards northwest of Bummer Lake, GR-21 is quite similar to GR-20. Habitat is marginal and the lake may winterkill. GR-21 is 3.7 acres, 10,355 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 7 feet. Fishing is very light for stocked brook trout.

GR-31
This natural, irregular shaped lake is essentially an on stream portion of the Sheep Creek Canal, which supplies irrigation water to northern Daggett County. This makes the lake fairly easy to find. Simply follow the canal 1.2 miles northwest from its junction with the Leidy Peak Trail [012]. GR-31 is the first lake you come to directly below the canals first major waterfall. Total distance from Browne Lake is approximately 4.1 miles. The lake is 6.0 acres, 9,270 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 6 feet. There is no spring water, campsites, or horse feed in the immediate vicinity. Horse feed and a few campsites are available in a small meadow along the canal 0.3 miles upstream. Fishing pressure is very light for naturally produced brook trout.

GR-104
This 4.3 acre natural pond sits on a steep bench overlooking the Sheep Creek Canal approximately 3.1 miles from both the Beaver Creek Trail head and Spirit Lake. GR-104 is located 0.3 miles west of the junction of Forest Service trails 017 and 052. The lake lies at an elevation of 9,290 feet and is surrounded by rocky timber. Maximum depth is 19 feet. Campsites and spring water are not available in the immediate area. The lake does not have inlets or an outlet and does not overwinter trout. This is another water where grayling may be stocked sometime in the future. Contact the Division of Wildlife Resources Office in Vernal for up-to-date information. Fishing pressure is very light.

HIDDEN, GR-7
Hidden Lake is a picturesque, natural lake which lies at the bottom of a wet meadow 0.7 miles northwest of Lower Anson Lake in Weyman Lakes Basin. Total distance from the Beaver Creek Trail head is 9.0 miles. Horses should be ridden only as far as Anson Lakes. From that point access is cross-country through downed timber and across scattered boulder fields. The lake is 8.5 acres, 10,380 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 26 feet. Spring water can be found on the lakes southwestern shore, but campsites are few and far between in the rough country which surrounds the lake. Fishing pressure is light for stocked brook trout. The lake also supports a small number of cutthroat trout.

HIDDEN, GR-112
This natural lake, not to be confused with another water of the same name in Weyman Lake Basin, is surrounded by heavy timber and rock slides 0.8 miles northwest of the Spirit Lake campground. Direct access is through downed timber and across scattered boulder fields. The going is a little easier if you travel to Lost Lake via the maintained trail and then north cross-country 0.2 miles to Hidden. Total distance for this route is 1.3 miles. The lake is 4.3 acres, 10,270 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 8 feet. Campsites are limited due to the rough terrain, and there are no reliable sources of spring water. A small amount of horse feed is located on the lakes eastern shore. Hidden Lake is stocked with brook trout but also produces an occasional cutthroat trout. Fishing pressure is light.

JESSON, GR-1
Jesson Lake is a fairly large, popular water which lies approximately 1.0 mile southwest of Spirit Lake via a maintained but rocky trail. This natural lake is surrounded by rocky timber and good campsites are difficult to find. Spring water and a minute amount of horse feed are located on the west shoreline. Jesson Lake is 25.5 acres, 10,392 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 56 feet. Brook trout are regularly stocked, but don't be surprised if you land an occasional cutthroat. Fishing pressure is heavy.

JUDY, GR-25
This seldom visited, picturesque pond sits on a high bench 0.4 miles south of Tamarack Lake. The most direct access is from the south shore of Tamarack. A hard scramble up 400 vertical feet puts you on top of the bench. Judy Lake lies a short distance further south at the base of the boulder fields. Total distance from Spirit Lake is 1.8 miles. The lake is 4.7 acres, 10,830 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 24 feet. Horse access is difficult and there is no horse feed at the lake. No spring water is found in the immediate vicinity, and campsites are scarce due to the rough, rocky terrain. Fishing pressure is light for stocked brook trout.

LAMB, GR-19
Lamb Lake is located at the bottom of a small brushy meadow in the western lobe of Lamb Lakes Basin. Abutting a steep rock slide, this relatively murky lake is 6.0 acres, 10,540 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 10 feet. There is no trail to the lake. Follow access directions to Bummer Lake. Lamb Lake lies to the west 0.9 miles across downed timber and rocks. The lake is surrounded by rocky timber but generally has an open shoreline. Horse feed and campsites are scarce due to the rough terrain; however, spring water is abundant. This lake has marginal fish habitat and may be fishless. Fishing pressure is light.

LILY PAD, GR-11
This lake does not support fish life. It is shown on the map as a landmark.

LOST, GR-4
This shallow pond is located just north of the trail between Spirit and Tamarack lakes. Approximately 0.3 miles past Lily Pad Lake (not stocked) turn north off the trail. Lost Lake is 0.1 miles down the slope. Total distance from Spirit Lake is 1.1 miles. The lake can also be reached by following the outlet of Tamarack Lake northeast 0.3 miles. Lost Lake is 3.2 acres, 10,300 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of only 7 feet. Good water exchange enables fish to survive the winter in Lost Lake despite the fairly shallow water. A handful of campsites are available at the lake. Horse feed is limited, however, and spring water is not available. Cutthroat trout are able to reproduce in Lost Lake so stocking has been discontinued for the time being. Fishing pressure is light.

LOST (Mystery), GR-101 
This pretty, elongated lake lies in a pocket formed by two oblique ridges and is surrounded by dense timber. There is a trail to the lake, but it can be difficult to find. Follow the south bank of the Sheep Creek Canal downstream from the Leidy Peak Trail. Approximately 0.2 miles upstream of GR-31 the trail cuts up the slope to the south. Lost Lake, also called Mystery Lake in some references, is 1.1 miles further along the trail. The lake is 10.2 acres, 9,750 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 25 feet. Total distance from Browne Lake is 4.9 miles. Spring water is located on the lakes south shore. There is no horse feed, and decent campsites are difficult to find because of the rocky, timbered slopes around the lake. The lake is periodically stocked with brook trout. Cutthroat trout are also present in the lake. Fishing pressure is light to moderate.

MUTTON, GR-23
This natural lake abuts a rocky slope in the southern corner of Lamb Lakes Basin. There is no trail to the lake. Easiest access is to follow the inlet of Bummer Lake 0.6 miles south to Mutton. Total distance from Browne Lake is 7.0 miles. Mutton Lake is 3.8 acres, 10,570 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 10 feet. Spring water is available at the lake, and a few campsites can be found around the inlet area. Horse feed is not abundant, and horse access to the lake, or anywhere in the basin, is difficult due to the rough terrain. Fishing pressure is very light for stocked brook trout.

ONE FISH, GR-32
One Fish Lake is located in heavy timber just a few yards north of the Sheep Creek Canal 0.3 miles downstream from where the canal crosses the Leidy Peak Trail. Total distance from Browne Lake is 3.0 miles. Campsites, horse feed and spring water are available in the large meadow 0.2 miles southeast of the canal. The lake is 4.5 acres, 9,350 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 35 feet. Unless you are an expert don't bother taking a fly rod. The dense timber makes back casting almost impossible. Fishing pressure is light for stocked brook trout.

PENGUIN, GR-16
This small, boulder-strewn pond is located just a few yards west of Upper Anson Lake in Weyman Lakes Basin. Penguin Lake is surrounded by talus slopes and rocky moraines. The lake is 2.1 acres, 10,665 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 20 feet. Total distances from Spirit Lake and the Beaver Creek Trail head are 7.1 and 9.0 miles, respectively. Campsites, spring water and horse feed are available in the vicinity of Anson lakes. Penguin supports a naturally reproducing population of pan-sized brook trout. Fishing pressure is light to moderate.

POTTER, LOWER, GR-27
This small circular pond is located just a few yards northeast of the much larger Upper Potter Lake. See the Upper Potter description for access instructions. Lower Potter Lake is 3.4 acres when full, 10,130 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 16 feet. Campsites are practically nonexistent because of the extremely rocky terrain. Horse feed is scarce for the same reason, and there is no spring water in the immediate vicinity. Fishing pressure is moderate for brook trout sustained by natural reproduction.

POTTER, UPPER, GR-27
Upper Potter Lake is a fairly large, deep, elongated lake located at the base of a steep rock slide. Easiest access is from Browne Lake. Follow the trail from Browne Lake to the bottom of Lamb Lakes Basin. Approximately 1.0 mile beyond where the trail crosses the West Fork of Carter Creek a faint trail cuts off to the south. Upper Potter Lake lies at the end of this trail. Total distance from Browne Lake is approximately 6.5 miles. A topo map is a good thing to carry if you are not familiar with the country. Upper Potter Lake is 21.3 acres, 10,130 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 75 feet. Campsites are not available in the immediate vicinity due to the rough terrain. There is no horse feed or spring water at the lake. Upper Potter is not stocked; however, the lake contains a self-sustaining population of brook trout. Fishing pressure is light.

RAM, GR-24
Ram Lake lies at the base of a rock slide approximately 0.6 miles west-southwest of Bummer Lake in Lamb Lakes Basin. See Bummer Lake for more detailed access instructions. Total distance from Browne Lake is 6.9 miles. There is no maintained trail into the basin. Ram Lake is 7.0 acres, 10,380 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 27 feet. The rough, rocky terrain in the immediate area affords few good campsites. Spring water is found in good supply along the eastern margin of the talus while horse feed is available in wet meadows to the west. This lake may contain a small population of cutthroat trout. Fishing pressure is light.

RED, GR-33
This fairly large, irregular shaped lake is located at the end of a rough, rocky trail 1.2 miles south of the Teepee Lakes. The trail to Red Lake diverges from the Leidy Peak Trail just south of its junction with the Sheep Creek Canal. Total distance from Browne Lake is 4.4 miles. Leidy Peak, located south of the lake, provides a stunning backdrop. Red Lake is 20.9 acres, 9,850 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 57 feet. Good campsites are very infrequent in the rough, timbered country surrounding the lake. Spring water is also unavailable. Sparse horse feed can be found in meadows to the north along the outlet. Deep sod-covered potholes abound in the meadow. You may want to picket horses on firmer ground rather than turning them loose with hobbles. Fishing pressure is light to moderate for stocked brook trout.

SESAME, GR-15
Surrounded by boulder fields and talus slopes, Sesame Lake lies in a shallow depression 0.4 miles west of Upper Anson Lake in Weyman Lakes Basin. The most direct access is due west from Penguin Lake up the rock slide and across some of the roughest boulder fields in the Uintas. Use caution when traversing the rocks. Even 5 ton boulders can sometimes shift when stepped on. The lake is located 7.4 and 9.3 miles, respectively from Spirit Lake and the Beaver Creek Trail head. Sesame Lake is 6.0 acres, 10,780 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 7 feet. The nearest campsites, spring water and horse feed are found at Anson Lakes. Sesame Lake is occasionally stocked with brook trout. Fishing pressure is very light. Fishing can be spotty as the lake may experience partial winterkill during particularly harsh winters.

SUMMIT, GR-5
This pretty, hourglass shaped lake sits at the bottom of a steep talus slope a short mile south of Spirit Lake. Easiest access is to travel due south of Spirit Lake until you hit a line of steep cliffs. Follow the base of the slope to Summit. The lake is 9.9 acres, 10,460 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of only 7 feet. Winterkill has been a problem in the past and, as of this writing, the lake does not support a fishery. Future plans call for the stocking of Arctic grayling on an experimental basis. Contact the Division of Wildlife Resources office in Vernal to inquire about the lakes status before you plan a trip. Even without a fishery, the lake is worth a visit. There is no spring water, however, good campsites and horse feed.

TAMARACK, GR-2
Tamarack Lake is by far the largest lake in the Sheep/Carter Creek Drainage system. Located 1.4 miles west of Spirit Lake via a rocky but maintained Forest Service trail, Tamarack is a popular fishing lake for day hikers and scout groups. The lake is 79.1 acres, 10,429 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 90 feet. The best camping sites are found on the east side of the lake while a few springs can be found along the southern shoreline. A few small meadows east of the lake contain horse feed. Tamarack Lake supports a naturally reproducing population of brook trout. A small number of cutthroat also inhabit the lake. Fishing pressure is heavy.

TEEPEE, LOWER, GR-28
Lower Teepee Lake is a hourglass shaped lake surrounded by fairly heavy timber located at the head of the Sheep Creek Canal and 2.9 miles by trail from Browne Lake. Follow the canal upstream 0.2 miles from its junction with the Leidy Peak Trail. Lower Teepee Lake is 4.3 acres and sits at an elevation of 9,410 feet. The western basin of the lake is only 6 feet at its deepest point, but the larger eastern basin drops to 28 feet fairly quickly. Campsites, horse feed, and spring water are available in the vicinity of a long meadow 0.1 miles west of the lake across the trail. Fishing pressure is moderate to heavy for stocked brook trout.

TEEPEE, UPPER, GR-30
This circular lake is located in dense timber 150 yards southeast of Lower Teepee Lake (see Lower Teepee Lake access). Upper Teepee Lake is 6.5 acres, 9,430 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 28 feet. Campsites are limited, and there are no springs or horse feed in the area. Fishing could be spotty as the lake winterkills occasionally. It may have a few cutthroat trout. Fishing pressure is moderate.

BENNION, LOWER, GR-134
Lower Bennion is a natural, somewhat elongated lake lying at the base of North Burro Peak in the southwestern corner of the Burnt Fork drainage. A maintained trail goes only as far as Island Lake. Lower Bennion, also called Bennion Lake in some texts, is located approximately 0.7 miles west of Island Lake across a large meadow and up a timbered slope. The lake lies 10.8 miles from Spirit Lake and 10.1 miles from Hoop Lake via Kabell Ridge. Lower Bennion is 7.7 acres, 10,950 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 13 feet. Campsites and spring water are found at the lake. Horse feed is located in small meadows along the eastern shore or in the vicinity of Whitewall Lake, a short distance to the southeast. The lake is stocked cyclicly with brook trout but also contains a small self-sustaining population of cutthroat trout. Fishing pressure is light.

BENNION, UPPER, GR-135
This small shallow pond is located on the edge of a rocky meadow only a few hundred yards upstream of Lower Bennion Lake. Upper Bennion Lake is 2.0 acres, 10,970 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 3 feet. Facilities and distances from major trail heads are as described for Lower Bennion. This lake is not stocked; however, both brook and cutthroat trout can migrate from Lower Bennion to Upper Bennion through the short connecting stream. Fishing pressure is light.

BOXER, GR-126
Boxer Lake is a relatively shallow, natural pond located against a talus slope at the head of a basin in the southeastern corner of the Burnt Fork drainage. A faint trail begins at the western end of Fish Lake (see Fish Lake access) and eventually cuts south across a ridge to Burnt Fork Lake. Boxer lies 0.3 miles to the southeast. The lake is 6.0 acres, 10,700 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 11 feet. Total distance from Spirit Lake is 6.5 miles. The lake is 10.6 miles from Hoop Lake via the Burnt Fork Trail. Campsites are plentiful, and large areas of wet meadow supply excellent horse feed. Spring water is found along the west shore of Boxer Lake or along the meadow edge. Fishing pressure is moderate for cutthroat trout. There is some natural reproduction, and stocking has been discontinued on an experimental basis.

BURNT FORK, GR-127
Burnt Fork Lake lies one mile by faint trail from the western end of Fish Lake (see Fish Lake access). The trail winds westerly along the base of a ridge and then cuts south over the ridge to the lake. Burnt Fork Lake is 9.8 acres, 10,630 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 25 feet. The lake abuts a rock slide on its east side and is located 6.1 and 10.2 miles from Spirit Lake and the Hoop Lake Campground, respectively. Campsites, horse feed and spring water are located in areas as described for Boxer Lake. Cutthroat trout reproduce naturally, and stocking has been discontinued. Fishing pressure is moderate.

CRYSTAL, GR-128
This shallow, natural pond is located at the bottom of a steep talus slope 0.6 miles southwest of Burnt Fork Lake. Direct access is down a fairly steep, timber covered slope. If your compass bearing is right, you will exit the trees at the lake. A longer but more sure access route is to follow the outlet of Burnt Fork Lake down the slope until you reach a wet grassy meadow. The outlet stream of Crystal Lake flows into Burnt Fork Creek on the west side of the meadow. Crystal is located 6.7 miles from Spirit Lake and 9.2 miles from Hoop Lake via the Burnt Fork Trail. The lake is 5.4 acres, 10,380 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of only 5 feet. The terrain is rough and sloping. Campsites are scarce, and horse feed is not plentiful. Spring water is located on the lakes south side. Cutthroat trout sustain themselves without stocking. A few brook trout also inhabit the lake. Fishing pressure is very light.

Fish Lake is a relatively large, narrow lake bordered along its entire south shore by a steep rock slide. The lake sits atop the divide between the Burnt Fork and Sheep Creek drainage. A maintained Forest Service trail dead ends at the lakes western tip. Total distance from Spirit Lake and Hoop Lake via the Burnt Fork Trail is 5.1 and 9.2 miles, respectively. Fish Lake is 38.3 acres, 10,685 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 23 feet. Campsites and spring water are available at the lake. The best horse feed is located in a large park 0.5 miles north along the trail. Fish Lake is periodically stocked with brook trout but also holds a few cutthroat. Fishing pressure is moderate to heavy.

ISLAND, GR-132
Island Lake is a large impounded water located in the southwest corner of the Burnt Fork drainage. The lake is used for water storage, and the water level fluctuates according to irrigation demand downstream. The area is quite popular with scout groups and other campers. Island Lake lies 8.9 miles from Hoop Lake via the trail across Kabell Ridge and 9.6 miles from Spirit Lake to the east. Lakes in the Uinta River drainage (Fox Lake area) are easily accessible across a pass to the south of the lake. Island Lake is 117.8 acres at full pool, 10,777 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 34 feet. Excellent campsites are in the vicinity. Spring water is located along the lake's south shore. The best horse feed is found around Whitewall Lake to the west or in a narrow meadow north of the lake. Island Lake contains a self-sustaining population of cutthroat trout and fair numbers of brook trout. Fishing pressure is heavy.

KABELL, GR-140
Kabell Lake is another popular lake with large hiking groups. From Hoop Lake a maintained trail leads south to Kabell Meadows. At the upper end of the meadows a trail splits off to the southeast and begins to climb the eastern tip of Kabell Ridge. A short distance down this trail a spur trail cuts to the right and terminates at Kabell Lake. Total distance from Hoop Lake is 5.2 miles. Kabell Lake is 14.7 acres, 10,348 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 23 feet. The lake is almost completely surrounded by dense timber, and campsites are fairly scarce. Small meadows located to the north along the outlet provide horse feed and possible camping areas. Spring water is found along the south side of the lake. Fishing pressure is moderate for stocked cutthroat trout.

ROUND, GR-131
Round Lake is a natural, picturesque lake which sits 0.4 miles southeast of the Island Lake outlet through heavy timber. Total distance from Spirit Lake and Hoop Lake via Kabell Ridge is 10.2 and 9.3 miles, respectively. Round Lake is 24.3 acres, 10,662 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 38 feet. Excellent campsites, horse feed and spring water are available in the immediate vicinity. Fishing pressure is moderate for stocked cutthroat trout.

Access is 3/4 mile south of G-78 around the rocky ridge. The terrain is steep and rugged and should not be attempted on horseback. Suitable camping areas are available with a good source of spring water. G-79 was scheduled to receive experimental stocking of brook trout during 1983.

G-80
This remote glacial lake is located in rocky, timbered terrain high on the ridge overlooking the West Fork Drainage. It is 1.8 acres, 10,580 feet in elevation, with 8 feet maximum depth. The lake abuts a steep talus slope to the west which is prone to snowslides. Access is 2 1/4 miles south of the West Fork-Blacks Fork Trailhead on the West Fork Trail to the upper end of Buck Pasture and then 3/4 mile west up the steep timbered slope to the small basin containing G-80. Access is difficult and should not be attempted on horseback. Marginal campsites are available with a good source of spring water. G-80 is stocked occasionally with brook trout and receives light fishing pressure.

G-81
G-81 is a small spring-fed lake located in partly timbered terrain in the West Fork Drainage. It is 1.6 acres, 10,665 feet in elevation, with 5 feet maximum depth. The lake is semi-circular in outline. It is turquoise in color due to a suspension of fine glacial material. G-81 is located 3/4 mile southwest of G-82 at the southern end of the large cirque basin against a talus slope. The terrain is steep, there are no trails, and horse access may be difficult. Campsites are available with a good source of spring water. Horse feed is extremely limited. G-81 is stocked infrequently with cutthroat trout.

G-82
G-82 is a shallow natural lake located in a boggy meadow on the ridge overlooking the West Fork Drainage. The lake is 3.8 acres, 10,140 feet in elevation, with 6 feet maximum depth. The lake is irregular in outline and composed of 2 arms connected by a narrow channel. G-82 is brown in color due to a fine suspended glacial material. Access is 1/4 mile southwest of the old scaler's cabin at the West Fork-Blacks Fork Trailhead up the steep timbered ridge. The lake is situated in thick timber, but it can be located by following the drainage system. Direct access on horseback is difficult. Camping areas are available. Spring water is not present. G-82 contains a small population of wary brook trout. The lake is subject to some water level fluctuation and may winterkill on occasion.

The Forest Service maintains a small full service campground at Little Lyman with 10 units. Little Lyman Lake is stocked on an annual basis with rainbow trout catchables and brook trout fingerling. Angling pressure is heavy due to the accessibility of this water.

LYMAN, G-27
This large scenic lake is situated immediately north and east of Little Lyman Lake in the West Fork Drainage (see directions to Little Lyman Lake). Lyman is 36.6 acres, 9,311 feet in elevation, with 30 feet maximum depth. A small dam has been placed across the outlet stream at Lyman to enlarge the original lake dimensions. Lyman is easily accessible and sustains heavy levels of fishing pressure. A summer youth camp has been established at the northeastern end of the lake. Good sites are available for primitive camping activity in the lake vicinity. However, a full service campground is maintained by the Forest Service at the nearby Little Lyman Lake with tap water and restroom facilities. Lyman has a history of winterkill and the fishery is sustained by periodic stockings of catchable-sized rainbow and albino rainbow trout. However, experimental stocking of brook trout was accomplished during 1983 and 1984 to evaluate the winterkill situation at this water.

MOSLANDER, G-102
Moslander is a productive reservoired lake located in the West Muddy Creek Drainage of the Blacks Fork Basin. It is 11.4 acres maximum, 9,691 feet in elevation, with 29 feet maximum depth.

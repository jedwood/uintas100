Access is 11 miles southwest of the China Meadows Trailhead on the well used East Fork Smiths Fork Trail some 2 miles beyond Lower Red Castle Lake. Campsites and horse feed are not available in the immediate lake vicinity due to the open and rocky nature of the surrounding terrain. However, good camping areas with cover, horse feed and running water are available in timbered areas to the north. Fishing pressure is moderate to heavy for stocked cutthroat trout. Due to the size and depth of this popular water, Red Castle is most effectively fished with an inflatable raft of some type. However, if inflatables are used, be sure to carry life jackets and exercise extreme caution. Red Castle Lake is subject to occasional high winds and rapid changes in weather due to the high elevation of this water. RED CASTLE, EAST, G-17 This deep natural lake is located in a steep walled cirque basin at the foot of Red Castle Peak in the Smiths Fork Drainage. East Red Castle is 21.1 acres, 11,190 feet in elevation, with 58-foot maximum depth. The lake is situated in open timberline terrain and campsites are not available in the immediate lake vicinity. However, good camping areas with horse feed can be located to the northeast. Several good sources of spring water are present at the lake. East Red Castle is located 3/8 mile northwest of Smiths Fork Pass Lake against the steep talus ridge. The cutthroat trout population present in East Red Castle is unusually wary and these fish may be difficult to catch at times. This water experiences moderate levels of angling pressure.

The lake is located some 9 miles south and west of China Meadows on the well maintained East Fork Smiths Fork Trail to just beyond the switchbacks. Lower Red Castle is a popular and well known lake receiving substantial fishing pressure. Good campsites are available but tend to be overused and fuelwood is extremely sparse. As a result, users are encouraged to carry in backpack stoves and make use of existing fire rings whenever possible. Spring water can be located during wet years and horse feed is available in boggy meadows surrounding the lake. People using horses should exercise proper management of pack animals to minimize impact to meadow areas. Lower Red Castle is currently stocked with rainbow trout, but cutthroat and brook trout are present as well. RED CASTLE, UPPER, G-16 This deep natural lake is situated in a rugged cirque basin well above timberline at the head of the Smiths Fork Basin. Upper Red Castle is 25.6 acres, 11,542 feet in elevation, with 72-foot maximum depth. The lake is located at the top of a steep rocky ridge 1/8 mile south of the large Red Castle Lake. Access is difficult and impossible on horseback due to the steep talus slopes and vertical cliffs on either side of Red Castle Lake. Campsites are not available due to the extreme elevation and rugged nature of the lake basin. However, an excellent spring water source is available at the lake. Upper Red Castle sustains moderate to light fishing pressure and is stocked with cutthroat trout on a periodic basis. This lake has developed a reputation for slow fishing which produces an occasional large cutthroat trout."

GR-104   | (No name)                 | 4.3ac    | 19ft   | ?ft elev   | Low      | 
         DWR: This 4.3 acre natural pond sits on a steep bench overlooking the Sheep Creek Canal approximately 3.1 miles from both the Beaver Creek Trail head and Spirit Lake. GR-104 is located 0.3 miles west of the junction of Forest Service trails 017 and 052. The lake lies at an elevation of 9,290 feet and is surrounded by rocky timber. Maximum depth is 19 feet. Campsites and spring water are not available in the immediate area. The lake does not have inlets or an outlet and does not overwinter trout. This is another water where grayling may be stocked sometime in the future. Contact the Division of Wildlife Resources Office in Vernal for up-to-date information. Fishing pressure is very light.
GR-11    | (No name)                 | 2.6ac    | 8ft    | 10635ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: This 2.6 acre pothole lake sits 200 yards southwest of Upper Anson Lake. Campsites, horse feed and sources of spring water are as described for Anson Lakes. GR-11 is 10,635 feet in elevation and has a maximum depth of 8 feet. This lake provides only marginal fish habitat and may winterkill. Fishing pressure is quite light for stocked brook trout.
GR-119   | (No name)                 | ?ac      | ?ft    | ?ft elev   | ?        | 
GR-13    | (No name)                 | 9.2ac    | ?ft    | ?ft elev   | Low      | 
         DWR: This natural moraine lake is situated on a glacial shelf at the bottom of a cirque in western Weyman Lakes Basin. The east-west orientation of the cirque makes this 9.2 acre lake susceptible to severe winds. GR-13 is located at timberline at an elevation of 10,820 feet and is surrounded by boulder fields and weathered stands of sub-alpine fir. The lake lies 0.7 miles west of Anson Lakes up rock slides and across rough boulder fields. Total distance from Spirit Lake and Beaver Creek Trail head is 7.8 and 9.7 miles, respectively. Horses are best left at Anson Lakes. Campsites are nonexistent, and no spring water is available. GR-13 is rather unique in that the lakes underground outlet is a visible siphon found along the northeastern shore. Fishing pressure is very light for stocked brook trout.
GR-15    | Sesame                    | 6.0ac    | 7ft    | 10780ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: Surrounded by boulder fields and talus slopes, Sesame Lake lies in a shallow depression 0.4 miles west of Upper Anson Lake in Weyman Lakes Basin. The most direct access is due west from Penguin Lake up the rock slide and across some of the roughest boulder fields in the Uintas. Use caution when traversing the rocks. Even 5 ton boulders can sometimes shift when stepped on. The lake is located 7.4 and 9.3 miles, respectively from Spirit Lake and the Beaver Creek Trail head. Sesame Lake is 6.0 acres, 10,780 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 7 feet. The nearest campsites, spring water and horse feed are found at Anson Lakes. Sesame Lake is occasionally stocked with brook trout. Fishing pressure is very light. Fishing can be spotty as the lake may experience partial winterkill during particularly harsh winters.
GR-16    | Penguin                   | 2.1ac    | 20ft   | 10665ft elev | Moderate | 
         DWR: This small, boulder-strewn pond is located just a few yards west of Upper Anson Lake in Weyman Lakes Basin. Penguin Lake is surrounded by talus slopes and rocky moraines. The lake is 2.1 acres, 10,665 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 20 feet. Total distances from Spirit Lake and the Beaver Creek Trail head are 7.1 and 9.0 miles, respectively. Campsites, spring water and horse feed are available in the vicinity of Anson lakes. Penguin supports a naturally reproducing population of pan-sized brook trout. Fishing pressure is light to moderate.
GR-19    | Lamb                      | 6.0ac    | 10ft   | 10540ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: Lamb Lake is located at the bottom of a small brushy meadow in the western lobe of Lamb Lakes Basin. Abutting a steep rock slide, this relatively murky lake is 6.0 acres, 10,540 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 10 feet. There is no trail to the lake. Follow access directions to Bummer Lake. Lamb Lake lies to the west 0.9 miles across downed timber and rocks. The lake is surrounded by rocky timber but generally has an open shoreline. Horse feed and campsites are scarce due to the rough terrain; however, spring water is abundant. This lake has marginal fish habitat and may be fishless. Fishing pressure is light.
GR-20    | (No name)                 | 5.7ac    | 8ft    | 10355ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: GR-20 is a fairly shallow, rocky pond which sits a short distance southwest of Bummer Lake in Lamb Lakes Basin. This lake is 5.7 acres, 10,355 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 8 feet. Access and camping are as described for Bummer Lake. The inlets and outlet of GR-20 are intermittent, and the lake provides only marginal fish habitat. Fishing is very light for stocked brook trout.
GR-21    | (No name)                 | 3.7ac    | 7ft    | 10355ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: Located less than 200 yards northwest of Bummer Lake, GR-21 is quite similar to GR-20. Habitat is marginal and the lake may winterkill. GR-21 is 3.7 acres, 10,355 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 7 feet. Fishing is very light for stocked brook trout.
GR-23    | Mutton                    | 3.8ac    | 10ft   | 10570ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: This natural lake abuts a rocky slope in the southern corner of Lamb Lakes Basin. There is no trail to the lake. Easiest access is to follow the inlet of Bummer Lake 0.6 miles south to Mutton. Total distance from Browne Lake is 7.0 miles. Mutton Lake is 3.8 acres, 10,570 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 10 feet. Spring water is available at the lake, and a few campsites can be found around the inlet area. Horse feed is not abundant, and horse access to the lake, or anywhere in the basin, is difficult due to the rough terrain. Fishing pressure is very light for stocked brook trout.
GR-24    | RAM                       | 7.0ac    | 27ft   | 10380ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: Ram Lake lies at the base of a rock slide approximately 0.6 miles west-southwest of Bummer Lake in Lamb Lakes Basin. See Bummer Lake for more detailed access instructions. Total distance from Browne Lake is 6.9 miles. There is no maintained trail into the basin. Ram Lake is 7.0 acres, 10,380 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 27 feet. The rough, rocky terrain in the immediate area affords few good campsites. Spring water is found in good supply along the eastern margin of the talus while horse feed is available in wet meadows to the west. This lake may contain a small population of cutthroat trout. Fishing pressure is light.
GR-31    | (No name)                 | 6.0ac    | 6ft    | 9270ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: This natural, irregular shaped lake is essentially an on stream portion of the Sheep Creek Canal, which supplies irrigation water to northern Daggett County. This makes the lake fairly easy to find. Simply follow the canal 1.2 miles northwest from its junction with the Leidy Peak Trail [012]. GR-31 is the first lake you come to directly below the canal's first major waterfall. Total distance from Browne Lake is approximately 4.1 miles. The lake is 6.0 acres, 9,270 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 6 feet. There is no spring water, campsites, or horse feed in the immediate vicinity. Horse feed and a few campsites are available in a small meadow along the canal 0.3 miles upstream. Fishing pressure is very light for naturally produced brook trout.

         DWR: This pretty, hourglass shaped lake sits at the bottom of a steep talus slope a short mile south of Spirit Lake. Easiest access is to travel due south of Spirit Lake until you hit a line of steep cliffs. Follow the base of the slope to Summit. The lake is 9.9 acres, 10,460 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of only 7 feet. Winterkill has been a problem in the past and, as of this writing, the lake does not support a fishery. Future plans call for the stocking of Arctic grayling on an experimental basis. Contact the Division of Wildlife Resources office in Vernal to inquire about the lake's status before you plan a trip. Even without a fishery, the lake is worth a visit.

BR-1     | Bourbon lake (Gold Hill)  | 1.9ac    | 8ft    | 9820ft elev | Moderate | 
         DWR: Bourbon is a small crescent-shaped lake in timbered country at the foot of a steep, jagged peak and associated talus rock. It is 1.9 acres, 9,820 feet in elevation, with 8 feet maximum depth. Campsites are poor in the lake vicinity, but a spring water source is available. Bourbon is located 1 steep mile west of Highway U-150 on the Whiskey Creek Trail which begins across the highway from the Sulpher Campground. Access is also afforded by the Whiskey Creek Road which begins across the highway from and slightly north of the Kletting Peak Information Turnoff. Follow this road north and west for 2¼ miles to the end and then continue northwest on foot for ¼ mile to the lake. Bourbon, containing a population of brook trout, is a popular fishing spot.
BR-10    | Beaver                    | 13.2ac   | 32ft   | 9420ft elev | Moderate | 
         DWR: Beaver is a scenic meadow lake located in open terrain characterized by grassy slopes and scattered groves of conifers in the West Fork Drainage. The lake is 13.2 acres, 9,420 feet in elevation, with 32 feet maximum depth. Beaver is easily accessible on the Moffit Pass Road 1¾ miles southwest of the Whitney Reservoir dam. The total distance from U-150 in the Hayden Fork Drainage is about 9 miles. Excellent sites are available for camping activity, but spring water and fuelwood are scarce. Large shallow shelves and dense growths of aquatic vegetation around the lake perimeter make shore fishing very difficult. Anglers are encouraged to bring boats or rubber rafts. Beaver Lake is productive in nature and subject to frequent winterkill. As a result, the Forest Service has installed a water circulator on the surface of this lake in an attempt to improve winter survival. Beaver is currently stocked on an annual basis with catchable-sized rainbow trout and may contain brook and cutthroat trout.
BR-11    | Lilly                     | 12.6ac   | 20ft   | 8890ft elev | Moderate | 
         DWR: Lily is an extremely large beaver pond situated in partly open, timbered terrain east of U-150 in the East Fork Drainage. It is 12.6 acres, 8,890 feet in elevation, with 20 feet maximum depth. Access is 1 mile north of the Bear River Ranger Station on U-150 to a well marked turnoff and then some miles southeast on the unimproved Lily Lake-Boundary Creek Road to the lake. Primitive camping areas are available with no source of spring water. A forest fire occurred in the vicinity of Lily Lake during 1980 burning much of the timber to the east of the lake. Lily is stocked on an annual basis with catchable rainbow trout. However, this productive water may stagnate late in the summer and the best fishing usually occurs prior to July 20. Lily sustains moderate levels of fisherman utilization.
BR-12    | Scow                      | 22.9ac   | 6ft    | 10100ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: Scow is a spring-fed meadow lake located in heavy timber on the ridge between the Stillwater and Boundary Creek Drainages. It is 22.9 acres, 10,100 feet in elevation, with 6 feet maximum depth. Access is 2¾ miles south of the East Fork of the Bear River Boy Scout Camp on the Boundary Creek Trail past the old burn to a small off-stream meadow. From this point, continue south for ¾ mile through thick timber to the lake. Campsites are present with some horse feed in surrounding wet meadows. Spring water is readily available during the early summer months. Scow is stocked with brook trout, but fishing is unpredictable due to the occasional occurrence of winterkill.
BR-14    | Mcpheters                 | 28.0ac   | 45ft   | 10860ft elev | Moderate | 
         DWR: This picturesque natural lake is situated near timberline at the head of the Middle Basin of the Stillwater Fork Drainage. McPheters is 28.8 acres, 10,860 feet in elevation, with 45 feet maximum depth. The surrounding terrain is composed of extensive bedrock shelves, windswept alpine meadows, and talus slopes. The lake is irregular in outline with a narrow, shallow arm to the east. Access is ¼ mile northwest of Ryder Lake to the top of the rocky ridge. The total distance from the Christmas Meadows Trailhead is 9 miles. Campsites and horse feed are not immediately available due to the open nature of the terrain and absence of fuelwood. However, good sites are present nearby. Spring water is plentiful. McPheters Lake is stocked with cutthroat trout.
BR-15    | Ryder                     | 23.7ac   | 55ft   | 10620ft elev | Moderate | 
         DWR: This deep natural lake is situated in open timber with beautiful meadows and steep, rocky ledges. Ryder is 23.7 acres, 10,620 feet in elevation, with 55 feet maximum depth. Inlets cascade off cliffs to the west adding to the aesthetic qualities of this water. Access is 8¼ miles south of the Christmas Meadows Trailhead on the Stillwater Pack Trail. This trail becomes indistinct and difficult to locate in meadow areas immediately east of the lake, but the route is clearly marked with rock cairns. Campsites are present with spring water sources. Horse feed is available in limited supply, but is more abundant to the east adjacent to the access trail. Ryder contains a large population of brook trout and produces some fair fly fishing on occasion.
BR-16    | (No name)                 | 1.0ac    | 5ft    | 10610ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: BR-16 is a small, narrow pond situated at the foot of a rocky ridge on the stream immediately below Ryder in the Stillwater Fork Drainage. It is 1.0 acre, 10,610 feet in elevation, with 5 feet maximum depth. Suitable camping areas are available in the lake vicinity with horse pasture in large parks to the east. Spring water can be obtained at the nearby Ryder Lake. BR-16 contains a population of brook and cutthroat trout maintained by natural reproduction and recruitment from Ryder. Fishing pressure is regarded as moderate to light.
BR-17    | (No name)                 | 2.8ac    | 7ft    | 10630ft elev | Moderate |

Good camping opportunities are available with excellent sources of spring water. Horse feed is located to the north. The best route of access is to head ¼ mile southeast of the Stillwater Pack Trail from the vicinity of the large meadows due east of Ryder. Meadow contains a population of brook trout sustained by natural reproduction. The lake experiences light angling pressure and provides a good opportunity for anglers who wish to get away from the crowds.
BR-2     | (No name)                 | 0.7ac    | 5ft    | 9780ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: This productive meadow pond is located some 100 yards downstream from Bourbon Lake in the Hayden Fork of the Bear River Drainage. It is 0.7 acres, 9,780 feet in elevation, with 5 feet maximum depth. Small and quite shallow, BR-2 would not appear to provide suitable fish habitat. However, the lake contains a population of brook trout sustained by natural reproduction and downstream migration from Bourbon Lake. Camping opportunities are available with a limited supply of horse feed. Spring water is available at Bourbon. Fishing pressure is light despite the easy access afforded by the Whiskey Creek timber road.
BR-20    | Kermsuh                   | 12.4ac   | 14ft   | 10300ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: Kermsuh is a long, narrow lake situated in rocky timbered country in the isolated West Basin of the Stillwater Fork Drainage. It is 12.4 acres, 10,300 feet in elevation, with 14 feet maximum depth. Campsites are poor due to the rocky nature of the surrounding terrain, but running water is abundant. Horse feed can be located in a small meadow to the south. Access is 1¾ miles south of Christmas Meadows on the Stillwater Pack Trail to the junction with the Kermsuh Lake Trail and then 2¼ miles southwest up the steep grade into West Basin. The cutthroat trout population is sustained by natural reproduction. This lake provides a good opportunity for users seeking solitude.

         DWR: Black Lake is a popular body of water located 15 miles from the Upper Stillwater Trailhead and 10.6 miles from Mirror Lake via Rocky Sea Pass. It is 11.8 acres, 10,403 feet in elevation, with 14 feet maximum depth. Well-marked access trails lead to the lake. Black Lake is often visited by Scout troops hiking the Highline Trail. An abundant population of brook trout is sustained by stocking and some natural reproduction. Some cutthroat trout are also present. Angling pressure is moderate to heavy. Campsites are plentiful in the general area, and springs are found along the west side of the lake. Horse feed may be found in open meadows 1/2 mile north of the lake. Black Lake is susceptible to overuse, especially during years when Rocky Sea Pass is snow-free most of the summer, allowing easier access from trailheads to the west.

         DWR: Tamarack Lake is by far the largest lake in the Sheep/Carter Creek Drainage system. Located 1.4 miles west of Spirit Lake via a rocky but maintained Forest Service trail, Tamarack is a popular fishing lake for day hikers and scout groups. The lake is 79.1 acres, 10,429 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 90 feet. The best camping sites are found on the east side of the lake while a few springs can be found along the southern shoreline. A few small meadows east of the lake contain horse feed. Tamarack Lake supports a naturally reproducing population of brook trout. A small number of cutthroat also inhabit the lake. Fishing pressure is heavy.
GR-22    | Bummer                    | 1.9ac    | 6ft    | 10350ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: This small, shallow lake is located on the east side of Lamb Lakes Basin approximately 6.5 miles from Browne Lake. There is no maintained trail for the last 1.5 miles. The most direct access to lakes in this basin is cross-country from the junction of Forest Service trails 018-I and 017 southwest up the bottom of the basin. The going is rough through rocky timber and across boulder fields. Horse access is impossible by this route and should not be attempted. Supposedly, horses can get into Lamb Lakes Basin via two little-used trails, one which drops from the ridge southeast of Bummer Lake, the other which drops from the ridge northwest of Ewe Lake. The existence of these trails was not verified during this project. Horse use in Lamb Lakes Basin would be restricted due to the rocky terrain. Bummer Lake is 1.9 acres, 10,350 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 6 feet. Wading can be an effective way to fish this lake. Use extreme caution, however, because footing is quite treacherous. The lake is periodically stocked with brook trout. Good campsites are rare, and there is no spring water. A little horse feed is found near the inlet. Fishing pressure is light.

         DWR: This seldom visited, picturesque pond sits on a high bench 0.4 miles south of Tamarack Lake. The most direct access is from the south shore of Tamarack. A hard scramble up 400 vertical feet puts you on top of the bench. Judy Lake lies a short distance further south at the base of the boulder fields. Total distance from Spirit Lake is 1.8 miles. The lake is 4.7 acres, 10,830 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 24 feet. Horse access is difficult and there is no horse feed at the lake. No spring water is found in the immediate vicinity, and campsites are scarce due to the rough, rocky terrain. Fishing pressure is light for stocked brook trout.

Lost Lake is 0.1 miles down the slope. Total distance from Spirit Lake is 1.1 miles. The lake can also be reached by following the outlet of Tamarack Lake northeast 0.3 miles. Lost Lake is 3.2 acres, 10,300 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of only 7 feet. Good water exchange enables fish to survive the winter in Lost Lake despite the fairly shallow water. A handful of campsites are available at the lake. Horse feed is limited, however, and spring water is not available. Cutthroat trout are able to reproduce in Lost Lake so stocking has been discontinued for the time being. Fishing pressure is light.
GR-6     | Dagget                    | 42.6ac   | 29ft   | 10462ft elev | High     | 
         DWR: Located only 2.6 miles southeast of Spirit Lake via a good trail, Daggett Lake is one of the more accessible and popular lakes in the Sheep Creek drainage. It is 42.6 acres, 10,462 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 29 feet. Campsites are scattered around the lake. Spring water, although present, is not abundant. Horse feed can be found in a narrow meadow north of the lake or along the outlet below the dam. Daggett Lake is noted for hordes of mosquitoes that can quickly turn a pleasant hike into a real ordeal. Come prepared with lots of insect repellant. Fishing pressure is heavy for stocked rainbow trout. An occasional cutthroat can also be taken.
GR-7     | Hidden                    | 8.5ac    | 26ft   | 10380ft elev | Low      | 
         DWR: Hidden Lake is a picturesque, natural lake which lies at the bottom of a wet meadow 0.7 miles northwest of Lower Anson Lake in Weyman Lakes Basin. Total distance from the Beaver Creek Trail head is 9.0 miles. Horses should be ridden only as far as Anson Lakes. From that point access is cross-country through downed timber and across scattered boulder fields. The lake is 8.5 acres, 10,380 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 26 feet. Spring water can be found on the lake's southwestern shore, but campsites are few and far between in the rough country which surrounds the lake. Fishing pressure is light for stocked brook trout. The lake also supports a small number of cutthroat trout.
GR-9     | Anson Lower               | 14.5ac   | 20ft   | 10575ft elev | Moderate | 
         DWR: Located at the end of the maintained trail into Weyman Lakes Basin, Lower Anson Lake is impossible to miss. Total distance from Spirit Lake and the Beaver Creek Trail head are 6.2 and 8.1 miles, respectively. The lake is 14.5 acres, 10,575 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 20 feet. Good campsites are infrequent in rough, rocky terrain. The best spots are in the vicinity of the trail. Horse feed is spotty. If you plan an extended trip, it is probably a good idea to pasture horses in the meadows along the stream between Lower and Upper Anson lakes. There is no spring water at Lower Anson, but there is a large spring on the east side of the creek about 0.1 mile north of Upper Anson Lake. Lower Anson Lake has been stocked in the past with brook trout. Due to apparent success of natural reproduction, stocking of brook trout was discontinued. Fishing pressure is moderate to heavy on this fairly popular water. A few cutthroat trout are also available.

         DWR: This lake sits next to a steep bald mountain and has an earthen dam which allows water levels to fluctuate 7 feet. It is 38.3 acres, 10,894 feet in elevation, with 32 feet maximum depth. Access is gained by following the east inlet stream from Spider Lake southwest 1/4 mile to Bluebell. The last 1/4 mile is thick willows, pines and large boulders, so it is best to leave horses at Spider and walk into Bluebell. Campsites near the lake are sparse and very little horse feed is available. Brook trout are very abundant and a few cutthroat are also present; both species reproduce naturally. Fishing pressure is moderate.

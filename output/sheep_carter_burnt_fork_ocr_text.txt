There are over 62 major lakes in the Sheep/Carter
Creek Drainage. Four of these, Browne Lake,
Sheep Creek Lake, Spirit Lake, and Long
Park Reservoir, are large impounded
waters accessible by vehicle. These are
not discussed further in this booklet;
however, all provide angling and car
camping opportunities, Of the remain-
ing major lakes, 34 contain populations
of game fish or are under experimental
fisheries management. The drainage also
contains well over 300 waters that are less
than 2 acres in size. Most of these small lakes and
ponds are not permanent. Some of the on stream ponds may contain popula-
tions of small pan-sized trout. Managed lakes range in elevation from 9,200 to
nearly 11,000 feet with the majority located at elevations above 10,000 feet.

There are two major access points to lakes of the Sheep/Carter Creek
Drainage. A relatively high quality dirt road leads to the west from Utah S.R. 44
and provides vehicle access to trail heads at Browne and Spirit lakes. This road
continues to the north and intersects Wyoming S.R. 414 near McKinnon. Lakes

of the Teepee Lakes area, Lamb Lakes Basin, and Weyman Lakes Basin are
served by trail heads near

Browne Lake. Trails which
originate at Spirit Lake pro-
vide access to Weyman
Lakes Basin, Daggett Lake, —
and the Jesson/Tamarack
lakes area. Lakes in the
eastern Burnt Fork
Drainage are also accessible via the trail head at Spirit Lake. All trails are well
marked except where noted in the individual lake texts. Each of the trails are
identified by name and Forest Service trail number on the accompanying map.

Additional inquires concerning trai! conditions should be directed to the U. S.
Forest Service office in Manila, Utah.

The Teepee Lakes area, Daggett Lake, and the Jesson/Tamarack lakes area
generally receive the heaviest angling pressure. These areas are all within a few
miles of the major trail heads and receive considerable day use. Recreational
use in the Weyman Lakes Basin is only moderate, generally because overnight
camping is usually required. Lamb Lakes Basin receives the least recreational
pressure due to the lack of maintained trails and the abundant boulder fields in
the basin’ lower reaches. Generally lakes which lie some distance from the

trails, even when located close to the trail heads, offer the best opportunity to
those in search of solace.

i

The most abundant fish species in lakes of this
drainage is brook trout which occurs in over 65% of
the waters listed. Cutthroat trout are not uncommon in
a number of lakes while rainbow trout are found exclu-
sively in Daggett Lake. If Arctic grayling become avail-
able, several fishless lakes may be stocked on an experi-
mental basis.

ANSON, LOWER, GR-9. Located at the end of the
maintained trail into Weyman Lakes Basin, Lower Anson Lake is impos-

sible to miss. Total distance from Spirit Lake and the Beaver Creek Trail
head are 6.2 and 8.1 miles, respectively. The lake is 14.5 acres, 10,575
feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 20 feet. Good campsites

ry are infrequent in rough, rocky terrain. The best spots are in the vicinity

. of the trail. Horse feed is spotty. If you plan an extended trip, it is prob-

ably a good idea to pasture horses in the meadows along the stream
between Lower and Upper Anson lakes. There is no spring water at
Lower Anson, but there is a large spring on the east side of the creek
about 0.1 mile north of Upper Anson Lake. Lower Anson Lake has
been stocked in the past with brook trout. Due to apparent success of
natural reproduction, stocking of brook trout was discontinued.

Fishing pressure is moderate to heavy on this fairly popular water. A
few cutthroat trout are also available.

ANSON, UPPER, GR-10. Upper Anson is a natural lake just 0.2 miles south of
Lower Anson Lake in the Weyman Lakes Basin. A maintained Forest
Service trail drops down from higher country to Lower Anson. From
there a faint trail leads south along the east side of the creek to Upper
Anson. Total distance from the Beaver Creek Trail head and Spirit Lake
is 8.8 and 6.9 miles, respectively. Upper Anson Lake is 7.7 acres,
10,660 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 58 feet. Horses can
travel within 100 yards of the lake but no further due to rocky terrain.
There are no good campsites at the lake itself, however spring water is
available. Campsites, horse feed and additional spring water are found
between Upper and Lower Anson lakes. Upper Anson Lake contains a
population of brook trout which sustains itself through natural repro-
duction. Fishing pressure is moderate.

BUMMER, GR-22. This small, shallow lake is located on the east side of Lamb
Lakes Basin approximately 6.5 miles from Browne Lake. There is no
maintained trail for the last 1.5 miles. The most direct access to lakes in

this basin is cross-country from the junction of Forest Service trails 018-
| and 017 southwest up the bottom of the basin. The going is rough
through rocky timber and across boulder fields. Horse access is impos-
sible by this route and should not be attempted. Supposedly, horses
can get into Lamb Lakes Basin via two little-used trails, one which
drops from the ridge southeast of Bummer Lake, the other which
drops from the ridge northwest of Ewe Lake. The existence of these
trails was not verified during this project. Horse use in Lamb Lakes
Basin would be restricted due to the rocky terrain. Bummer Lake is 1.9
acres, 10,350 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 6 feet.
Wading can be an effective way to fish this lake. Use extreme caution,
however, because footing is quite treacherous. The lake is periodically
stocked with brook trout. Good campsites are rare, and there is no
spring water. A little horse feed is found near the inlet. Fishing pres-
sure is light.

CANDY, GR-17. Candy Lake is a rocky 5.5 acre pond lying in the northeast

ry

corner of Weyman Lakes Basin approximately 8.8 miles from the
Beaver Creek Trail head. Follow the directions to Hidden Lake (GR-7).
Candy lies 0.2 miles north through rocky timber. Horses can be taken
as far as Lower Anson Lake. Candy Lake sits at an elevation of 10,290
feet and has a maximum depth of 29 feet. Campsites are rare in the
immediate vicinity, but spring water is present. The lake does not over-
winter fish due to poor inlet flows, and stocking has been discontin-
ued indefinitely. The lake may be experimentally planted sometime in
the future with Arctic grayling which may prove more tolerant of the
harsh environment. Check with the Division of Wildlife Resources
Office in Vernal for the current management of this lake.

CLEAR, GR-12. This pretty lake is aptly named. Located in Weyman Lakes

Basin, Clear Lake lies 0.4 miles west of Lower Anson Lake, 8.5 miles

from the Beaver Creek Trail head and 6.6 miles from Spirit Lake. The

last 0.4 miles is through rocky timber, and horse access is impossible
beyond Anson lakes. The lake is 10.2 acres, 10,780 feet in elevation
with a maximum depth of 25 feet. No campsites or spring water are
found in the immediate area. Fishing pressure is light. The lake may

contain cutthroat trout.

COLUMBINE, GR-116. Columbine Lake sits on a rocky bench at the base of a

talus slope 1.3 miles southwest of Spirit Lake. The lake is 5.7 acres and
10,550 feet in elevation. Follow the Middle Fork of Sheep Creek
upstream from Spirit Lake until the stream goes underground. The lake
lies across the boulder fields to the south. Horse access is impossible.
Spring water is available at the lake, and a few campsites can be
found in a grassy area on the lakeS southwestern shore. Despite only
a 5 foot maximum depth and a lake level that tends to fluctuate dur-

weet

ing drier years, Columbine Lake still manages to support a small popu-
lation of brook trout maintained through periodic stocking. Fishing
pressure is light.

DAGGETT, GR-6. Located only 2.6 miles southeast of Spirit Lake via a good

mA)
my

trail, Daggett Lake is one of the more accessible and popular lakes in
the Sheep Creek drainage. It is 42.6 acres, 10,462 feet in elevation
with a maximum depth of 29 feet. Campsites are scattered around the
lake. Spring water, although present, is not abundant. Horse feed can
be found in a narrow meadow north of the lake or along the outlet
below the dam. Daggett Lake is noted for hordes of mosquitoes that
can quickly turn a pleasant hike into a real ordeal. Come prepared
with lots of insect repellant. Fishing pressure is heavy for stocked rain-
bow trout. An occasional cutthroat can also be taken.

EWE, GR-18. Ewe Lake is located at the bottom of a talus slope in western

(4)

Lamb Lake Basin. It is 3.0 acres, 10,750 feet in elevation with a maxi-
mum depth of 10 feet. Ewe Lake is 7.3 miles from Browne Lake. The
last 2.3 miles is cross-country across rough terrain. See Bummer Lake
for a more detailed description of general access to the Lamb Lakes
area. Campsites are scarce, but spring water can be found at the lake.
Trout stocked in Ewe Lake in the past have not been able to overwin-
ter, and as of 1986 the lake is fishless. Grayling may be introduced in
the future on an experimental basis. Fishing pressure is light.

GAIL, GR-115. Gail is a small, seldom visited lake which sits at the bottom of a

rock slide approximately 1.1 miles southwest of Spirit Lake. Follow the
trail to Jesson Lake. Gail lies 0.2 miles to the south across downed tim-
ber and rocky terrain. The lake is 4.5 acres, 10,420 feet in elevation
with 25 feet maximum depth. There are no campsites in this rough
country, and spring water is not available. Horse access is difficult, if
not impossible. Gail supports a small population of cutthroat trout. An
occasional brook trout may also be taken. Fishing pressure is very
light.

GR-11. This 2.6 acre pothole lake sits 200 yards southwest of Upper Anson

Lake. Campsites, horse feed and sources of spring water are as
described for Anson Lakes. GR-11 is 10,635 feet in elevation and
has a maximum depth of 8 feet. This lake provides only marginal
fish habitat and may winterkill. Fishing pressure is quite light for
stocked brook trout.

GR-13. This natural moraine lake is situated on a glacial shelf at the bottom of

a cirque in western Weyman Lakes Basin. The east-west orientation of
the cirque makes this 9.2 acre lake susceptible to severe winds. GR-13

is located at timberline at an elevation of 10,820 feet and is surround-
ed by boulder fields and weathered stands of sub-alpine fir. The lake
lies 0.7 miles west of Anson Lakes up rock slides and across rough
boulder fields. Total distance from Spirit Lake and Beaver Creek Trail
head is 7.8 and 9.7 miles, respectively. Horses are best left at Anson
Lakes. Campsites are nonexistent, and no spring water is available. GR-
13 is rather unique in that the lakes underground outlet is a visible
siphon found along the northeastern shore. Fishing pressure is very
light for stocked brook trout.

GR-14, This lake does not support fish life. It is shown on the map as a land-
mark.

GR-20. GR-20 is a fairly shallow, rocky pond which sits a short distance south-
west of Bummer Lake in Lamb Lakes Basin. This lake is 5.7 acres,
10,355 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 8 feet. Access and
camping are as described for Bummer Lake. The inlets and outlet of
GR-20 are intermittent, and the lake provides only marginal fish habi-
tat. Fishing is very light for stocked brook trout.

GR-21. Located less than 200 yards northwest of Bummer Lake, GR-2! is quite
similar to GR-20. Habitat is marginal and the lake may winterkill. GR-21
is 3.7 acres, 10,355 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 7 feet.
Fishing is very light for stocked brook trout.

GR-31. This natural, irregular shaped lake is essentially an on stream portion of
the Sheep Creek Canal, which supplies irrigation water to northern
Daggett County. This makes the lake fairly easy to find. Simply follow
the canal 1.2 miles northwest from its junction with the Leidy Peak
Trail [012]. GR-31 is the first lake you come to directly below the canals
first major waterfall. Total distance from Browne Lake is approximately
4.1 miles. The lake is 6.0 acres, 9,270 feet in elevation with a maxi-
mum depth of 6 feet. There is no spring water, campsites, or horse
feed in the immediate vicinity. Horse feed and a few campsites are
available in a small meadow along the canal 0.3 miles upstream.
Fishing pressure is very light for naturally produced brook trout.

GR-104, This 4.3 acre natural pond sits on a steep bench overlooking the
Sheep Creek Canal approximately 3.1 miles from both the Beaver
Creek Trail head and Spirit Lake. GR-104 is located 0.3 miles west of
the junction of Forest Service trails 017 and 052. The lake lies at an
elevation of 9,290 feet and is surrounded by rocky timber. Maximum
depth is 19 feet. Campsites and spring water are not available in the
immediate area. The lake does not have inlets or an outlet and does
not overwinter trout. This is another water where grayling may be
stocked sometime in the future. Contact the Division of Wildlife
Resources Office in Vernal for up-to-date information. Fishing pressure
is very light.

HIDDEN, GR-7. Hidden Lake is a picturesque,
: natural lake which lies at the bottom
of a wet meadow 0.7 miles north-
‘ west of Lower Anson Lake in
Weyman Lakes Basin. Total distance
[4] from the Beaver Creek Trail head is
9.0 miles. Horses should be ridden
only as far as Anson Lakes. From that
point access is cross-country through RAINBOW
downed timber and across scattered boulder fields.
The lake is 8.5 acres, 10,380 feet in elevation with a maximum depth
of 26 feet. Spring water can be found on the lakes southwestern
shore, but campsites are few and far between in the rough country
which surrounds the lake. Fishing pressure is light for stocked brook
trout. The lake also supports a small number of cutthroat trout.

HIDDEN, GR-112. This natural lake, not to be confused with another water of
the same name in Weyman Lake Basin, is surrounded by heavy timber

A. and rock slides 0.8 miles northwest of the Spirit Lake campground.
Direct access is through downed timber and across scattered boulder

fields. The going is a little easier if you travel to Lost Lake via the main-

af tained trail and then north cross-country 0.2 miles to Hidden. Total dis-
tance for this route is 1.3 miles. The lake is 4.3 acres, 10,270 feet in
elevation with a maximum depth of 8 feet. Campsites are limited due
to the rough terrain, and there are no reliable sources of spring water.
A small amount of horse feed is located on the lakes eastern shore.
Hidden Lake is stocked with brook trout but also produces an occa-
sional cutthroat trout. Fishing pressure is light.

JESSON, GR-1. Jesson Lake is a fairly large, popular water which lies approxi-
mately 1.0 mile southwest of Spirit Lake via a maintained but rocky

trail. This natural lake is surrounded by rocky timber and good camp-

sites are difficult to find. Spring water and a minute amount of horse
feed are located on the west shoreline. Jesson Lake is 25.5 acres,
10,392 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 56 feet. Brook trout
are regularly stocked, but don't be surprised if you land an occasional
cutthroat. Fishing pressure is heavy.

JUDY, GR-25. This seldom visited, picturesque pond sits on a high bench 0.4
miles south of Tamarack Lake. The most direct access is from the south
shore of Tamarack. A hard scramble up 400 vertical feet puts you on
top of the bench. Judy Lake lies a short distance further south at the
base of the boulder fields. Total distance from Spirit Lake is 1.8 miles.
The lake is 4.7 acres, 10,830 feet in elevation with a maximum depth
of 24 feet. Horse access is difficult and there is no horse feed at the
lake. No spring water is found in the immediate vicinity, and campsites

are scarce due to the rough, rocky terrain. Fishing pressure is light for
stocked brook trout.

LAMB, GR-19. Lamb Lake is located at the bottom of a small brushy meadow
in the western lobe of Lamb Lakes Basin. Abutting a steep rock slide,
[a] this relatively murky lake is 6.0 acres, 10,540 feet in elevation with a
maximum depth of 10 feet. There is no trail to the lake. Follow access
directions to Bummer Lake. Lamb Lake lies to the west 0.9 miles across ‘
downed timber and rocks. The lake is surrounded by rocky timber but
generally has an open shoreline. Horse feed and campsites are
scarce due to the rough terrain; however, spring water is abun- |
dant. This lake has marginal fish habitat and may be fishless.
Fishing pressure is light.

LILY PAD, GR-11. This lake does not support fish life. It is shown on the map
as a landmark.

LOST, GR-4. This shallow pond is located just north of the trail between Spirit
and Tamarack lakes. Approximately 0.3 miles past Lily Pad Lake (not
stocked) turn north off the trail. Lost Lake is 0.1 miles down the slope.
Total distance from Spirit Lake is 1.1 miles. The lake can also be
reached by following the outlet of Tamarack Lake northeast 0.3 miles.
Lost Lake is 3.2 acres, 10,300 feet in elevation with a maximum depth
of only 7 feet. Good water exchange enables fish to survive the winter
in Lost Lake despite the fairly shallow water. A handful of campsites
are available at the lake. Horse feed is limited, however, and spring
water is not available. Cutthroat trout are able to reproduce in Lost
Lake so stocking has been discontinued for the time being. Fishing
pressure is light.

LOST, GR-101 (Mystery). This pretty, elongated lake lies in a pocket formed
by two oblique ridges and is surrounded by dense timber. There is a
trail to the lake, but it can be difficult to find. Follow the south bank of
the Sheep Creek Canal downstream from the Leidy Peak Trail.
Approximately 0.2 miles upstream of GR-31 the trail cuts up the slope
to the south. Lost Lake, also called Mystery Lake in some references, is
1.1 miles further along the trail. The lake is 10.2 acres, 9,750 feet in
elevation with a maximum depth of 25 feet. Total distance from
Browne Lake is 4.9 miles. Spring water is located on the lakes south
shore. There is no horse feed, and decent campsites are difficult to
find because of the rocky, timbered slopes around the lake. The lake is
periodically stocked with brook trout. Cutthroat trout are also present 7
in the lake. Fishing pressure is light to moderate.

MUTTON, GR-23. This natural lake abuts a rocky slope in the southern corner
of Lamb Lakes Basin. There is no trail to the lake. Easiest access is to

follow the inlet of Bummer Lake 0.6 miles south to Mutton. Total dis-

(a) tance from Browne Lake is 7.0 miles. Mutton Lake is 3.8 acres, 10,570

feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 10 feet. Spring water is
available at the lake, and a few campsites can be found around the
inlet area. Horse feed is not abundant, and horse access to the lake,
or anywhere in the basin, is difficult due to the rough terrain. Fishing
pressure is very light for stocked brook trout.

ONE FISH, GR-32. One Fish Lake is located in heavy timber just a few yards
north of the Sheep Creek Canal 0.3 miles downstream from where the
canal crosses the Leidy Peak Trail. Total distance from Browne Lake is
3.0 miles. Campsites, horse feed and spring water are available in the
large meadow 0.2 miles southeast of the canal. The lake is 4.5 acres,
9,350 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 35 feet. Unless you
are an expert don't bother taking a fly rod. The dense timber makes
back casting almost impossible. Fishing pressure is light for stocked
brook trout.

PENGUIN, GR-16. This small, boulder-strewn pond is located just a few yards
west of Upper Anson Lake in Weyman Lakes Basin. Penguin Lake is
surrounded by talus slopes and rocky moraines. The lake is 2.1 acres,
10,665 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 20 feet. Total dis-
tances from Spirit Lake and the Beaver Creek Trail head are 7.1 and
9.0 miles, respectively. Campsites, spring water and horse feed are
available in the vicinity of Anson lakes. Penguin supports a naturally
reproducing population of pan-sized brook trout. Fishing pressure is
light to moderate.

POTTER, LOWER, GR-27. This small circular pond is located just a few yards
northeast of the much larger Upper Potter Lake. See the Upper Potter
description for access instructions. Lower Potter Lake is 3.4 acres when
full, 10,130 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 16 feet.
Campsites are practically nonexistent because of the extremely rocky
terrain. Horse feed is scarce for the same reason, and there is no
spring water in the immediate vicinity. Fishing pressure is moderate for
brook trout sustained by natural reproduction.

POTTER, UPPER, GR-27. Upper Potter Lake is a fairly large, deep, elongated
lake located at the base of a steep rock slide. Easiest access is from
Browne Lake. Follow the trail from Browne Lake to the bottom of
Lamb Lakes Basin. Approximately 1.0 mile beyond where the trail
crosses the West Fork of Carter Creek a faint trail cuts off to the south.
Upper Potter Lake lies at the end of this trail. Total distance from
Browne Lake is approximately 6.5 miles. A topo map is a good thing
to carry if you are not familiar with the country. Upper Potter Lake is
21.3 acres, 10,130 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 75 feet.
Campsites are not available in the immediate vicinity due to the rough
terrain. There is no horse feed or spring water at the lake. Upper
Potter is not stocked; however, the lake contains a self-sustaining pop-

the lake is only 6 feet at its deepest point, but the larger eastern basin
drops to 28 feet fairly quickly. Campsites, horse feed, and spring water
are available in the vicinity of a long meadow 0.1 miles west of the
lake across the trail. Fishing pressure is moderate to heavy for stocked
brook trout.

TEEPEE, UPPER, GR-30. This circular lake is located in dense timber 150 yards

southeast of Lower Teepee Lake (see Lower Teepee Lake access}.
Upper Teepee Lake is 6.5 acres, 9,430 feet in elevation with a maxi-
mum depth of 28 feet. Campsites are limited, and there are no springs

terkills occasionally, It may have a few cutthroat trout. Fishing pressure
is moderate.

BURNT FORK DRAINAGE

he Burnt Fork drainage is located immediately west of
the Sheep/Carter Creek Drainage and south of Hoop Lake

——. on the north slope of the Uinta Mountains. This relatively
small drainage contains approximately 15 major lakes and over 100 small
ponds which are less than 2 acres in area and often ephemeral. Eleven of the
major lakes contain managed trout populations. Nearly all of the lakes which
support a fishery are found at eleva-
tions exceeding 10,500 feet. At
12,726 feet in elevation, South Burro
Peak is the highest point in the
drainage.

dirt road from Lonetree,
W/yoming, heads south to Hoop
Lake, the primary access point for the Burnt Fork drainage. The eastern portion
of the drainage can also be reached from Spirit Lake (see Sheep/Carter Creek
map). The highest recreational use is directed at lakes in the Island Lake area
and Kabell Lake. The popular lakes in the Fox Lake area of the upper Uinta
River drainage are also accessible from Island Lake via a pass to the south across
the Uinta divide. Additional questions concerning trail conditions should be
directed to the U.S. Forest Service office in Mountain View, Wyoming.

The predominant fish species found in Burnt Fork lakes is the cutthroat trout.
Only Fish Lake contains brook trout almost exclusively. Approximately half the
lakes contain populations of both species.

BENNION, LOWER, GR-134. Lower Bennion is a
natural, somewhat elongated lake lying at
the base of North Burro Peak in the south-
western corner of the Burnt Fork drainage.
A maintained trail goes only as far as Island
Lake. Lower Bennion, also called Bennion
Lake in some texts, is located approximately
0.7 miles west of Island Lake across a large

fies 10.8 miles from Spirit Lake and 10.1
miles from Hoop Lake via Kabell Ridge.
Lower Bennion is 7.7 acres, 10,950 feet in
elevation with a maximum depth of 13 feet.
Campsites and spring water are found at
the lake. Horse feed is located in small meadows along the eastern
shore or in the vicinity of Whitewall Lake, a short distance to the
southeast. The lake is stocked cyclicly with brook trout but also con-
tains a small self-sustaining population of cutthroat trout. Fishing pres-
sure is light.

ENNION, UPPER, GR-135. This smail shallow pond is located on the edge

B
A of a rocky meadow only a few hundred yards upstream of Lower

Bennion Lake. Upper Bennion Lake is 2.0 acres, 10,970 feet in eleva-
tion with a maximum depth of 3 feet. Facilities and distances from
major trail heads are as described for Lower Bennion. This lake is not
stocked; however, both brook and cutthroat trout can migrate from
4 | Lower Bennion to Upper Bennion through the short connecting
stream. Fishing pressure is light.

BOXER, GR-126. Boxer Lake is a relatively shallow, natural pond located
against a talus slope at the head of a basin in the southeastern corner
of the Burnt Fork drainage. A faint trail begins at the western end of
Fish Lake (see Fish Lake access) and eventually cuts south across a
ridge to Burnt Fork Lake. Boxer lies 0.3 miles to the southeast. The
lake is 6.0 acres, 10,700 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of

11 feet. Total distance from Spirit Lake is 6.5 miles. The lake is 10.6
miles from Hoop Lake via the Burnt Fork Trail. Campsites are plentiful,
and large areas of wet meadow supply excellent horse feed. Spring
water is found along the west shore of Boxer Lake or along the mead-
ow edge. Fishing pressure is moderate for cutthroat trout. There is
some natural reproduction, and stocking has been discontinued on an
4 experimental basis.

BURNT FORK, GR-127. Burnt Fork Lake lies one mile by faint trail from the
western end of Fish Lake (see Fish Lake access}. The trail winds wester-

ly along the base of a ridge and then cuts south over the ridge to the
lake. Burnt Fork Lake is 9.8 acres, 10,630 feet in elevation with a maxi-
mum depth of 25 feet. The lake abuts a rock slide on its east side and
is located 6.1 and 10.2 miles from Spirit Lake and the Hoop Lake
Campground, respectively. Campsites, horse feed and spring water are
located in areas as described for Boxer Lake. Cutthroat trout reproduce
naturally, and stocking has been discontinued. Fishing pressure is
moderate.

CRYSTAL, GR-128. This shallow, natural pond is located at the bottom of a

steep talus slope 0.6 miles southwest of Burnt Fork Lake. Direct access
is down a fairly steep, timber covered slope. If your compass bearing is
right, you will exit the trees at the lake. A longer but more sure access
route is to follow the outlet of Burnt Fork
Lake down the slope until you reach
a wet grassy meadow. The outlet
stream of Crystal Lake flows into
Burnt Fork Creek on the west
side of the meadow. Crystal is
located 6.7 miles from Spirit Lake
and 9.2 miles from Hoop Lake via the
Burnt Fork Trail. The lake is 5.4 acres,
10,380 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of only 5 feet. The
terrain is rough and sloping. Campsites are scarce, and horse feed is
not plentiful. Spring water is located on the lakes south side. Cutthroat
trout sustain themselves without stocking. A few brook trout also
inhabit the lake. Fishing pressure is very light.

FISH, GR-125. Fish Lake is a relatively large, narrow lake bordered along its

cas] >

entire south shore by a steep rock slide. The lake sits atop the divide
between the Burnt Fork and Sheep Creek drainage. A maintained
Forest Service trail dead ends at the lakes western tip. Total distance
from Spirit Lake and Hoop Lake via the Burnt Fork Trail is 5.1 and 9.2
miles, respectively. Fish Lake is 38.3 acres, 10,685 feet in elevation
with a maximum depth of 23 feet. Campsites and spring water are
available at the lake. The best horse feed is located in a large park 0.5
miles north along the trail. Fish Lake is periodically stocked with brook
trout but also holds a few cutthroat. Fishing pressure is moderate to
heavy.

ISLAND, GR-132. Island Lake is a large impounded water located in the south-

west corner of the Burnt Fork drainage. The lake is used for water
storage, and the water level fluctuates according to irrigation demand
downstream. The area is quite popular with scout groups and other
campers. Island Lake lies 8.9 miles from Hoop Lake via the trail across
Kabell Ridge and 9.6 miles from Spirit Lake to the east. Lakes in the

wear

Uinta River drainage (Fox Lake area) are easily accessible across a Pass
to the south of the lake. Island Lake is 117.8 acres at full pool, 10,777
feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 34 feet. Excellent campsites
are in the vicinity. Spring water is located along the lake's south shore.
The best horse feed is found around Whitewall Lake to the west or in
a narrow meadow north of the lake. Island Lake contains a self-sus-
taining population of cutthroat trout and fair numbers of brook trout.
Fishing pressure is heavy.

KABELL, GR-140. Kabell Lake is another popular lake with large hiking

groups. From Hoop Lake a maintained trail leads south to Kabel
Meadows. At the upper end of the meadows a trail splits off to the
southeast and begins to climb the eastern tip of Kabell Ridge. A short
distance down this trail a spur trail cuts to the right and terminates at
Kabell Lake. Total distance from Hoop Lake is 5.2 miles. Kabell Lake is
14.7 acres, 10,348 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 23 feet.
The lake is almost completely surrounded by dense timber, and camp-
sites are fairly scarce. Small meadows located to the north along the
outlet provide horse feed and possible camping areas. Spring water is
found along the south side of the lake. Fishing pressure is moderate
for stocked cutthroat trout.

ROUND, GR-131. Round Lake is a natural, picturesque lake which sits 0.4

- 8G

miles southeast of the Island Lake outlet through heavy timber. Total
distance from Spirit Lake and Hoop Lake via Kabell Ridge is 10.2 and
9.3 miles, respectively. Round Lake is 24.3 acres, 10,662 feet in eleva-
tion with a maximum depth of 38 feet. Excellent campsites, horse feed
and spring water are available in the immediate vicinity. Fishing pres-
sure is moderate for stocked cutthroat trout.

SNOW, GR-130. This pretty lake is surrounded on three sides by talus slides

(=)

and ledges. Snow Lake lies 0.3 miles east of Round Lake through a
rocky draw. The lake is located 10.6 miles from Spirit Lake and 9.9
miles from Hoop Lake via Kabell Ridge. Horse access is impossible.
Snow Lake, sometimes referred to as Andrea in older texts, is 9.4
acres, 10,550 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 35 feet. No
campsites are available due to the uneven rocky terrain. A number of
springs are located on the west end of the lake. Cutthroat trout are
planted cyclicly, and fishing pressure is light.

WHITEWALL, GR-133. Whitewall Lake is a shallow natural lake which sits in a

(

large meadow 0.4 miles west of Island Lake. The lake is located 9.8
miles from Hoop Lake across Kabell Ridge and 10.5 miles from Spirit
Lake. Campsites and horse feed are plentiful while a number of
springs are located on the west shore. Whitewall Lake is 14.5 acres,
10,900 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 3 feet. The lake is

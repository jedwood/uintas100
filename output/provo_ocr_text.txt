take-off points in the drainage include the Bald
Mountain and Upper Setting trailheads
which primarily provide access to Weber
Basin lakes, Additional Forest Service
trails in the Provo Drainage include the
Norway Fiats, Shingle Creek, North

Fork, Weir Lake and Upper Setting
Trails. Each of these trail systems are
identified on the map by Forest Service
trail numbers.

Most of the fishing and camping activity in
the Provo Drainage is concentrated along the
highway corridor and adjacent to Forest Service roads and major trails. Fulb-ser-
vice campgrounds are available at Trial, Lost and Lily lakes and fishing pressure
at these waters is very heavy, Several takes on the popular Lakes Country Trail
receive high levels of angling
pressure as well. However, the
remote lake basins away from
the major trails anc roads nave
much to offer for those seeking
solitude,

The most abundant fish species
in Provo Drainage lakes is the brook trout which occurs in 88 percent of all fish
producing waters. Cutthroat trout are commonly stocked in the drainage as
weil, The heavily fished waters adjacent to the highway receive frequent plants
of catchable-sized rainbow and albino rainbow trout. Arctic grayling are pre-
sent in Marjorie and Weir lakes.

U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps applicable to the Provo River
Drainage include the Mirror Lake, Erickson Basin, iron Mine Mountain and
Soapstone Basin quadrangles.

EBER RIV!

ihe Weber River is a large drainage system located on the western

extremity of the Uinta Mountains. The upper slopes are timbered with
extensive areas of exposed bedrock and talus ridges. Some 59 natural lakes
and between 80 and 100 ponds of less than 2 acres in size dot the headwater
fegion of the Weber River These lakes vary in ele-
vation from 9,620 feet to over 10,820 feet.
Eleven of these natural lakes have been
enlarged by dam construction for water
storage purposes.

Access to the drainage is provided by
Highway 213 east of Oakley and
Highway U-150 east of Kamas, Utah.
Starting points along Highway 213 include
the Erickson Basin Trailhead in the vicinity of
the Ledgefork Campground, and Holiday Park near
the forest boundary, Trails originating at Holiday Park extend south into the
major forks of the Weber River. However, Holiday Park is private property and
the Forest Service right-of-way road has no trailhead development or parking
areas for vehicles and horse trailers.

The major access points to the Weber Drainage are scattered along U-150
and inciude the Upper Setting Trailhead, the Crystal Lake Trailhead, the Baid
Mountain Trailhead and the Weber River Trail near Pass Lake (see Provo
Drainage Map). Trails originating at these points drop over the top into the
major headwater regions of the Weber Basin,

Some of the more inaccessible lakes in the Uinta Mountains lie within this
drainage. Forest Service trails are not well developed or maintained with the
exception of the Notch Mountain Loop Trail, the Lofty Lake Loop Trail, the
Smith-Morehouse Trail, and the Yellowpine Trail. Several trail systems, particularly
in the Middle Fork are no fonger in existence due to light foot and horse traffic.
All Weber Drainage trails which receive maintenance are identified on the book-
fet map by Forest Service trail numbers,

Although the Weber River Drainage lies in close proximity to areas of concen-
trated use, the majority of lakes experience moderate or light angling pressure.
The heaviest fishing and camping activity occurs at Abes, Cuberant #4, Dean,
Erickson, Fish, Lovenia, North, Notch, Round, Sand and Yellowpine (Lower and
Upper}. These areas should be avoided if users are seeking solitude.

There are 42 lakes in this drainage that contain game fish populations or are
under experimental fisheries management. Brook trout are the most common

a


=== PAGE 9 ===
species in the drainage and anglers are aiso likely to catch cutthroat trout
which occur quite frequently, Self-sustaining popuiations of Arctic grayling are

present in Sand, Round and Fish lakes in the Dry Fork Drainage. Stream fishing

is very good in some of the more remote areas of the Weber River Drainage.

USGS topographic maps useful in the Weber River Drainage include Whitney

Reservoir, Slader Basin, Hidden Lake, Mirrdr Lake, Erickson Basin, and the Hoyt
Peak quadrangles.

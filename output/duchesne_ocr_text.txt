tal fisheries evaluation. These lakes range from
9,850 feet to nearly 11,000 feet in elevation.
The highest point in the drainage is Spread
Eagle Peak which stands at 12,540 feet
above sea level.
Fisherman access to the drainage is
provided by U-150 east of Kamas
and Highway 35 north of Hanna, as
well as secondary Forest Service routes
including the Murdock Basin and Iron
Mine Mountain Timber roads. Fourteen of
the managed fish-producing lakes are directly
accessible to vehicles and most of the remainder
can be reached on a few miles of well-marked trails. The major developed take-
Off points include the Highline and Mirror Lake trailheads on U-150 and the
Sawmill Flat and Grandview trailheads on Highway 35. The Highline Trail is the
major access to the Primitive Area affording access to Naturalist Basin and the
Packard Lake Trail, as well as the headwater region of the Rock Creek Drainage
over the top of Rocky Sea Pass. The best access route to several waters along
the eastern rim of the drainage including Farney, Sonny and Marsell is via the
Grandaddy Trail from the Grandview Trailhead (see Rock Creek Drainage Map).
Other minor access routes
in the drainage include the
Olga Lake Trail, the
Duchesne River Trail, the
East Fork Trail, the Skinner
Cutoff Trail, the Pinto Lake
Trail, the Mirror Lake Trail,
the Blue Lake Trail and the
Fehr Lake Trail. These and other trails are identified on the Duchesne map by
trail number.

l= of the Duchesne Drainage receive substantial fishing pressure, partic-
ularly along the Mirror Lake Highway Corridor. Improved campgrounds
with picnic table, water and restroom facilities are available at Moosehorn,
Mirror and Butterfly lakes and the Great Salt Lake Council of the Boy Scouts
operates Camp Steiner at Scout Lake. Naturalist Basin receives heavy fishing and
camping activity as well, but this activity is localized to the Jordan Lake vicinity.
Fishermen planning trips to this area are encouraged to camp away from areas
of concentrated use and out of sight of lakes, trails and streams. Also be pre-
Pared for sparse wood for fuel and limited horse feed.

rook trout are the most abundant species in the Duchesne
Drainage, although cutthroat trout are frequently taken by fisher-
men as well. Rainbow and albino rainbow catchables are periodically stocked

weet

in Moosehorn, Mirror, Pass and Butterfly lakes. Arctic
grayling are abundant in Carolyn Lake.

USGS topographic maps applicable to the Duchesne
River Drainage include the Hayden Peak, Mirror Lake, Iron
Mine Mountain, and the Grandaddy Lake quadrangles.

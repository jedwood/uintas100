BEAR RIVER DRAINAGE

‘The Bear River is a large and scenic basin situated on the northwest
extremity of the Uinta Mountain Range. It is characterized by rugged,
precipitous mountains cut by narrow drainage basins to the east and
gently sloping timbered ridges to the west. By total land area, this drain-
age is the largest in the Uinta Mountains, There are 6 major tributary
systems in this basin including the West Fork, Hayden Fork, Main Fork,
Stillwater Fork, East Fork and the Mill Creek Drainage. ‘The highest
point of land is Lomotte Peak which stands at 12,720 feet in elevation. A
large portion of the lower country in this drainage, particularly in the
(West Fork and Mill Creek Areas, is privately owned and not open to
public access.

The Bear River Drainage is composed of some 38 natural lakes, | large
reservoir, and numerous small lakes and beaver ponds of less than 2
acres in size, Of these waters, 38 currently contain fish populations or are
scheduled for future experimental fisheries management. Lakes vary in
elevation from 9,984 at Mt. Elizabeth Lake to over 10,900 feet at BR-44.
Brook and cutthroat trout commonly occur in the back country lakes,
and arctic grayling have been experimentally stocked at Whiskey Island.
Lily Lake and Beaver Lake are subject to frequent winterkill. Asa result,
these lakes receive annual stocking of rainbow trout catchables, In addi-
tion, the cutthroat and brook trout fishery at Whitney Reservoir in the
West Fork Drainage is supplemented with rainbow trout catchables.

Access to the Bear River Drainage is provided by the Mirror Lake
Highway (U-150) east and north of Kamas, Utah or south of Evanston,
Wyoming, and associated Forest Service routes such as the Whitney,
Gold Hill, Stillwater, North Slope, East Fork and Mill Creek Roads.
Major access points to the back country areas of this drainage include the
Christmas Meadows and East Fork-Bear River Trailheads as well as the
Ruth Lake and Whiskey Creek Trail turnouts on U-150. The Christmas
Meadows Trailhead is fully developed with unloading facilities and a full
service campground. A few lakes are directly accessible to vehicles, but
the vast majority of these waters are remote and accessible only by trail or
cross-country travel. Lakes at the head of the Stillwater and East Fork
Drainages are situated within the wilderness area, and motorized or
mechanized equipment and vehicles are not allowed, The major access
trails in the drainage include the Bear River-Smiths Fork ‘Trail, the Ruth
Lake Trail, the Main Fork Stillwater Trail, the Sullwater Trail, the
Boundary Creek ‘Trail, the East Fork Bear River Trail, the Kermsuh
Lake Trail, the Amethyst Lake Trail, the Whiskey Creek Trail and the
Left Hand Fork Trail. Each of these trail systems is identified on the
drainage map by Forest Service trail numbers.

Despite the close proximity of the Bear River Drainage to U-150 and
other high use drainages on the western flank of the Uinta Mountains,
the majority of lakes in this drainage receive moderate or light recrea-
tional use. The heaviest fishing and camping activity occur at Ruth,
Bourbon, Teal, Lym, Beaver and Whitney Reservoir. These areas should
be avoided if users are seeking solitude in the basin.

U.S, Geological Survey topographic maps applicable to the Bear
River Drainage include the Mirror Lake, Hayden Peak, Red Knob,
Christmas Meadows, Whitney Reservoir, Seven Tree Flat, Deadman
Mountain and Elizabeth Mountain quadrangles. The High Uintas
Primitive Area Map available at ranger stations of the Wasatch and
Ashely National forests may also prove useful.

Road 1% miles southwest of the Whitney Reservoir dam. The toutl
distance from U-150 in the Hayden Fork Drainage is about 9 miles.
Excellent sites are available for camping activity, but spring water and
fuelwood are scarce. Large shallow shelves and dense growths of aquatic
vegetation around the lake perimeter make shore fishing very difficult
Anglers are encouraged to bring boats or rubber rafts. Beaver Lake is
productive in nature and subject to frequent winterkill. As a result, the
Forest Service has installed a water circulator on the surface of this lake in
an attempt to improve winter survival. Beaver is currently stocked on an
annual basis with catchable-sized rainbow trout and may contain brook
and cutthroat trout.

BLACKS FORK DRAINAGE

‘The Blacks Fork Basin is an isolated drainage on the north slope of
the Uinta Mountains located between the Bear River Drainage to the
west and the Smiths Fork Drainage to the east. This large drainage is
composed of 4 major tributaries, including the West Fork, Middle Fork,
East Fork and Little East Fork, each of which contain alpine lake concent-
rations in headwater regions, The terrain is rugged and composed of
narrow river valleys and steep rocky ridges with extensive areas of alpine
tundra. The highest point of land is Mount Lovenia at the head of the
East Fork Drainage which reaches 13,219 feet in elevation.

In general, lakes of the Blacks Fork Basin are small in size, widely
scattered between the 4 major subdrainages, and high in elevation with
nearly half situated at or above timberline. These lakes range in elevation
from 9,070 feet at G-90 to more than 11,500 feet at G-71 situated at the
foot of Squaw Pass, There are 33 natural lakes, 3 reservoirs, and over 100
ponds of less than 2 acres in size. Of these waters, 22 currently comain
populations of game fish, or are proposed for experimental fisheries
management. Two large reservoirs in this drainage, Fish and Meeks
Cabin, are not currently managed by the state of Utah to provide fish
populations. Fish Reservoir is privately owned and not open to public
access. Meeks Cabin Reservoir is situated in and managed by the state of

Wyoming.

‘The Blacks Fork Drainage is located approximately 15 miles south of
U-150 on the North Slope Road over Elizabeth Ridge, or 18 miles
southwest of Roberison, Wyoming, on the Blacks Fork Road. Both of
these routes are improved gravel roads maintained by the U.S. Forest
Service, Trailhead development in the drainage includes the Cache, East
Fork-Blacks Fork, and West Fork-Blacks Fork trailheads. Major trails
providing access to the back country include the Bear River-Smith Fork
Trail, the West Fork Blacks Fork Trail, the East Fork Blacks Fork Trail,
the Little East Fork Blacks Fork Trail and the Middle Fork Blacks Fork
‘Trail, The Middle Fork Trail is the poorest in this trail system due to
limited use and poor definition. All trails which receive maintenance are
identified on the Blacks Fork Drainage map by Forest Service Trail
number.

In general, recreational use and fishing activity in the Blacks Fork
Drainage are limited, due to the remote and scattered nature of lake
basins, limited trail maintenance, and difficult access. Of the managed
fish producing waters, $ can be reached on roads or jeep trails and only 2
are directly accessible on Forest Service trails. The ret der of these
lakes are situated some distance from roads and major access trails,
making cross-country travel necessary. As a result, nearly all of the lakes
in this drainage are subject to light fishing and camping activity provid-
ing excellent opportunities for anglers seeking solitude.

Brook and cutthroat trout are found in equal abundance in back
country lakes of the Blacks Fork Basin, ‘These populations are
supplemented by occasional aerial stocking, as needed, Duc to the acces-
sibility and heavy levels of fishing pressure directed to the Lyman Lakes,
these waters receive annual plants of brook trout and periodic stocking of
rainbow and or albino rainbow catchables.

Most of the waters in the headwater region of the Blacks Fork Basin
are situated within the High Uintas Wilderness Area and the usual
restrictions apply. Due to the rugged nature of the terrain and distance
between individual fishing waters, trips should be carefully planned
beforehand, U.S, Geological Survey maps useful in this drainage include
the Explorer Peak, Mount Lovenia, Red Knob, Elizabeth Mountain and
Lyman Lake quadrangles.

BOBS, G-73. Bobs is a scenic natural lake located in a glacial cirque at

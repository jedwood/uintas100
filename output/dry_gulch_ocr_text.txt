UINTA RIVER DRAINAGE

UINTA RIVER DRAINAGE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE IN TOPOGRA-
PHY IN THE UINTA MOUNTAINS. IT CONTAINS SEVEN MAJOR BASIN AREAS (KREBS,
Atwoop, Painter, Painter Lakes, GitBert, KIDNEY Lakes AND Fox-CRESCENT
Lakes) AND NUMEROUS MINOR ONES. Over 93 lakes and ponds drain into the
Uinta River tributaries between 10,100 and 11,750 feet elevation. Many lakes in
the upper end of the drainage are in open windswept tundra. Kings Peak
{13,528 feet}, highest mountain peak in Utah, is located in the most western
end of Painter Basin:

‘wo major trailheads provide access to the Uinta River drainage: {1} Uinta
Canyon Trailhead (near U-Bar Ranch}, located 21 miles north of Neola,
Utah, provides access to western portions of the drainage; and (2) West Fork of

a a

ecccccccccccc ecco cece cece ccccee,

the Whiterocks River drainage, located about 25 miles north of Whiterocks,
Utah, provides access to eastern portions of the drainage. The seven major lake
areas on the Uinta River are accessible by horse or foot travel. Horse pasture is
fairly abundant in most of the basins, except for Painter Lakes. Heaviest camp-
ing and fishing pressure are at the Chain lakes, Kidney lakes, Fox-Crescent lakes,
and to some extent, the Atwood lakes. These four areas should be avoided if
people want solitude. Deer, elk and moose can be found in meadow areas in
this drainage; and ptarmigan in the upper tundra. Also, sheep grazing occurs
in Glibert and Painter basins on a rotational basis during late summer.

here are 51 lakes in this drainage that contain trout populations, or are

under experimental fisheries management. The most abundant fish
species are brook and cutthroat trout, and occasionally rainbow and golden
trout. Natural reproduction is common and helps produce large trout popula-
tions in Chain 1, Chain 3, Atwood, Allred, Lily Pad, and U-76 lakes. Stream fish-
ing is excellent in most of the Uinta River drainage. These trout migrate out of
the lakes or are produced naturally in the tribu-
taries.

ALBERT, U-94. This cirque lake is locat-
ed in the far southwest cor-
ner of an extremely steep
and rocky basin. It is 7
acres, 10,826 feet in eleva-
tion, with 8 feet maximum -
depth. Access is to go north- - ATWOOD LAKE
west up a ridge 2 miles from Mer
Bollie Lake, then turn north and -
climb down a steep talus slope into the
basin. There are no trails, camping sites or horsefeed around the lake; horses
cannot be taken into Albert. Many pan-sized cutthroat inhabit the lake. These
fish are sustained by natural reproduction. The lake receives very litte fishing
pressure and is a must for the rugged outdoorsman.

ALLRED, U-14. This natural lake is located 18 miles from the Uinta River trailhead and
225 yards south of the Atwood Lake dam. It is 34 acres, 10,995 feet in eleva-
tion, with 30 feet maximum depth. The rocky trail is well marked but due to
the numerous steep switchbacks the distance seems longer than it is.
Campsites and horse pasture are both abundant around Allred Lake. Nice-
sized brook trout are quite numerous in the lake and are sustained through
natural reproduction. Fishing and camping pressure are moderate. Allred Lake
is a must for those wanting a rugged wilderness experience and fast fly-fishing
for plump brookies in the evening.

ATWOOD, U-16. Atwood Lake is the largest lake in the Uinta River drainage. It has an
earthen dam on the west end and water levels fluctuate considerably each
year. Atwood is approximately 200 acres, 11,030 feet in elevation, with 40
feet maximum depth. Access is 18 miles from U-Bar Ranch over a well-marked

eal

trail. Good campsites and horse feed are available around the lake. Atwood
Lake has one of the largest brook trout populations in the Uinta Mountains. A
few golden trout are also found in the lake. Camping and angling pressure
are moderate.

B-29 LAKE, U-18. This natural lake sits in a wet meadow in the far southeast comer of

Atwood Basin. It is 19 acres, 10,740 feet in elevation, with 7 feet maximum
depth. There is no marked trail to B-29, but it can be reached from Carrot Lake
by going east 1/4 mile after crossing Carrot Creek on the Atwood Lake trail.
Total miles from the Uinta River trailhead is 17.5 miles. Camping sites and
horse pasture are abundant around the lake; however, the pasture is quite
boggy. A large brook trout population inhabits the lake. Camping and fishing
pressure is light at B-29. Take plenty of insect repellent during July!

BEARD, U-74. The high cirque lake sits way above timberline at the eastern base of

South King’ Peak. It is 9 acres, 11,740 feet in elevation, with
an estimated 15 feet maximum depth. Access is to fol-
low the well marked Forest Service trail 22 miles
through Atwood Basin to Trail Rider Pass. Follow
the trail an additional 1/8 mile into Painter
Basin, then turn southwest and go 150 yards
into a small cirque basin to the lake. Horse
access is fairly rugged over the rocky terrain
(especially up Trail Rider Pass). There are no
horse pastures or camping areas in the
windswept tundra around the lake. Stocked brook
trout grow well in Beard and fishing pressure is quite
light.

BOLUE, U-96. This natural lake is surrounded by beautiful meadows and open timber.

itis 10 acres, 10,660 feet in elevation, with 15 feet maximum depth. Trail
access is via a primitive logging road 3 miles north past Jefferson Park to the
canyon rim. Follow the trail west for 2 miles along the rim until you reach the
lake near the head of the basin. Excellent campsites and abundant horse feed
are available around the lake. This lake contains cutthroat trout. Fishing pres-
sure and camping use are light. (Refer to the Dry Gulch drainage map for a
better illustration of the access route.)

BOWDEN, U-32. Bowden is a shaliow, natural lake located 1/2 mile southeast of the

Kidney Lakes. It is 4.5 acres, 10,693 feet in elevation, with 14 feet maximum
depth. Total distance from the U-Bar Ranch is 18.5 miles, the last half mile is
trailless. Horse access is good, and numerous campsites and pasture are avail-
able around the lake. Bowden Lake contains stocked brook trout. Camping
and fishing pressure is rated moderate. Bowden Lake has excellent food pro-
duction and may occasionally winterkill, so fishing is generally not fast.

BROOK, U-54. This natural lake can be reached by following the trail east I mile along

the north shore of Fox Lake. It is 10 acres, 10,950 feet is elevation, with 8 feet
maximum depth. It can also be reached by following the Highline Trail west
from Whiterocks drainage over North Pole Pass (first lake encountered}. Some
horse feed and campsites are available around the lake. Brook trout are

CRAIG, U-85. This natural lake is the first large
lake (and lower in elevation!) encoun-
tered in the Painter Lakes Basin. It is
9.3 acres, 10,848 feet in elevation,
and about 14 feet maximum depth.
Leave U-Bar Ranch and proceed via a
well-marked trail 14 miles to North
CHAIN 4 E Fork Park (where the North and Center Forks of
the Uinta River converge). Head due south for 2
very steep and rough miles up a vague trail (along a

small creek} into the Painter Lakes Basin. There are good
horse pastures and camping sites around the lake. Craig contains mostly cut-
throat trout along with an occasional brook trout. Fishing and camping pres-
sure are light.

CRESCENT, U-48. This long narrow reservoir fluctuates 4 feet annually. It is 31 acres,
A 10,830 feet in elevation, with 23 feet maximum depth. Access is very good via

two well marked forest service trails: the shortest is about 8 miles over the Fox
- Queant Pass from the West Fork Whiterocks River trailhead, and the other is
about 15.5 miles up the Shale Dugway from the U-Bar Ranch. Camping sites
ae available around the take and good horse pasture can be found 1/2 mile
north (Fox Lake} or west (large meadow) from Crescent. The Crescent Lake
fishery is mainly cutthroat trout along with a few brook trout. Camping and
fishing pressure is moderate to heavy, and the area is quite popular with large
scout groups during mid summer.

DAVIS, NORTH, U-46. This natural lake sits about 250 yards due north of South Davis
Lake, or about 1-1/4 miles north of the Kidney lakes. It is 7.3 acres, 11,060
feet in elevation, with 7 feet maximum depth. Good camping sites and abun-
dant horse pasture are found to the south é

between South Davis and the Kidney cs

lakes. North Davis contains small pan-

sized brook trout that are hard to
catch. These fish are stocked and
can freely move between both Davis}
lakes. Fishing pressure is light, but
camping pressure is moderate in the
vicinity.

DAVIS, SOUTH, U-34. This shallow lake sits ina
large, wet meadow | mile north of the Kidney
lakes. It is 6.1 acres, 11,020 feet in elevation, with 4 feet maximum depth.

trout inhabit the lake. Camping pressure is moderate, but angling pressure is
light. This lake is good for fly-fishing.

NORTH DAVIS LAKE

DIVIDE, U-59. This natural lake sits in windswept tundra below the mountain pass sep-
arating Uinta River drainage (south slope) from Burnt Fork drainage (north

weed

slope). It is 18.9 acres, 11,217 feet in elevation, with an estimated 39 feet
maximum depth. Access is 2 miles north from Fox Lake via the trail which
goes over the pass to Island Lake. No camping sites or horse feed are avai-
able around the lake or the vicinity. Divide Lake has been managed with cut-
throat trout. Angling pressure is considered light and limited to day use.

DOLLAR, U-49. This pretty lake is located in a large meadow, and is occasionally called

depth. Trail access is very good and the lake is located about | mile northwest
of Fox Lake. Total distance from U-Bar Ranch is 15 miles. Excellent horse feed
and camping sites are in the Dollar Lake vicinity. A natural population of pan-
sized brook trout inhabits the lake. Camping and fishing pressure are generally
rated moderate, though heavy use occasionally occurs from large groups.
Brookies spook easily in the meadow stream below Dollar, and are quite a
challenge for the fly fisherman.

FOX, U-47. This reservoired lake is popular despite 20-foot fluctuations annually. It is
102 surface acres at full pool, 10,790 feet in elevation, with 47 feet maximum
depth. Trails are well marked; and distance is either 15 miles from the U-Bar
Ranch to the south, or 8.5 miles from the West Fork Whiterocks River trailhead
to the east. Horse feed and heavily used camping areas are located in the
general area around the lake. Brook and cutthroat trout inhabit Fox.
Recreational use is generally moderate, however, large groups frequently visit
this lake, and the area has been abused.

GEORGE BEARD, U-21. This natural lake sits in open, windswept tundra. It is 7.4
acres, 11,420 feet in elevation, with 15 feet
maximum depth. Access is 2 miles via a
rocky trail from Atwood Lake and is

exist around the lake. Brook trout
have reproduced naturally at
George Beard and can be quite
abundant. Fishing pressure is limited
to day-users and considered light.

GILBERT, U-82. This natural lake sits at the head of

Gilbert Creek, a tributary to the Center Fork of

the Uinta River. It is 14.6 acres, 11,459 feet in elevation, with 20 feet maxi-

mum depth. Good trail access exists heading northwest from North Fork Park

for 6.5 miles. Total trail distance from U-Bar Ranch is 20.5 miles. Good camp-
ing and horse pasture exists 3 miles southeast of the lake. The lake is currently
stocked with brook trout. Fishing pressure is light. Sheep grazing during late
summer detracts from the aesthetic beauty of this meadowy alpine basin.

KIDNEY, EAST, U-25. This natural lake is located about 15 miles from the West Fork

Whiterocks River trailhead, or just under 18 miles from U-Bar Ranch; both

access trails are well marked. It is 13.7 acres, 10,850 feet in elevation, with 12

feet maximum depth. Horse pasture is abundant north of the lake. Camping

areas are abundant, but overused in the area between the Kidney lakes. The

WITH WILD THINGS AND NATURE, FAMILY AND =

FRIENDS ~ A PATHWAY OF ADVENTURE - A =
PATHWAY TO FIsHING! —

he new Pathways to Fishing Program is a trail

taking the curious youngster and beginning
angler through a simple discovery process in the con-
cepts, ethics and functions of fishing, implementing
simple basics of aquatic life and fishing through a sys-
tem of gentle instruction and hands-on experiences.
The Utah Division of Wildlife’s Pathway to Fishing is
a multi-station, one-hour walk-through program that
combines the basics of fishing with aquatic ecology,
and provides information about local fishing opportu-
nities. It’s beneficial to people of all ages. Parents and
guardians are encouraged to accompany the youngsters
through the program and learn with them.

he Pathways program is conducted by a team of

trained instructors from the area of the clinic.
These instructors are from various disciplines — some
are experienced anglers (often from local outdoor
clubs), others are business people from fishing tackle
stores, and some are fisheries biologists from agencies
| with natural resources responsibilities. The Utah

Division of Wildlife provides equipment and assis-

| tance.

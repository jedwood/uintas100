         DWR: This natural moraine lake is situated on a glacial shelf at the bottom of a cirque in western Weyman Lakes Basin. The east-west orientation of the cirque makes this 9.2 acre lake susceptible to severe winds. GR-13 is located at timberline at an elevation of 10,820 feet and is surrounded by boulder fields and weathered stands of sub-alpine fir. The lake lies 0.7 miles west of Anson Lakes up rock slides and across rough boulder fields. Total distance from Spirit Lake and Beaver Creek Trail head is 7.8 and 9.7 miles, respectively. Horses are best left at Anson Lakes. Campsites are nonexistent, and no spring water is available. GR-13 is rather unique in that the lakes underground outlet is a visible siphon found along the northeastern shore. Fishing pressure is very light for stocked brook trout.

         DWR: Surrounded by boulder fields and talus slopes, Sesame Lake lies in a shallow depression 0.4 miles west of Upper Anson Lake in Weyman Lakes Basin. The most direct access is due west from Penguin Lake up the rock slide and across some of the roughest boulder fields in the Uintas. Use caution when traversing the rocks. Even 5 ton boulders can sometimes shift when stepped on. The lake is located 7.4 and 9.3 miles, respectively from Spirit Lake and the Beaver Creek Trail head. Sesame Lake is 6.0 acres, 10,780 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 7 feet. The nearest campsites, spring water and horse feed are found at Anson Lakes. Sesame Lake is occasionally stocked with brook trout. Fishing pressure is very light. Fishing can be spotty as the lake may experience partial winterkill during particularly harsh winters.

         DWR: This pretty, hourglass shaped lake sits at the bottom of a steep talus slope a short mile south of Spirit Lake. Easiest access is to travel due south of Spirit Lake until you hit a line of steep cliffs. Follow the base of the slope to Summit. The lake is 9.9 acres, 10,460 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of only 7 feet. Winterkill has been a problem in the past and, as of this writing, the lake does not support a fishery. Future plans call for the stocking of Arctic grayling on an experimental basis. Contact the Division of Wildlife Resources office in Vernal to inquire about the lake's status before you plan a trip. Even without a fishery, the lake is worth a visit.

         DWR: Beaver is a scenic meadow lake located in open terrain characterized by grassy slopes and scattered groves of conifers in the West Fork Drainage. The lake is 13.2 acres, 9,420 feet in elevation, with 32 feet maximum depth. Beaver is easily accessible on the Moffit Pass Road 1¾ miles southwest of the Whitney Reservoir dam. The total distance from U-150 in the Hayden Fork Drainage is about 9 miles. Excellent sites are available for camping activity, but spring water and fuelwood are scarce. Large shallow shelves and dense growths of aquatic vegetation around the lake perimeter make shore fishing very difficult. Anglers are encouraged to bring boats or rubber rafts. Beaver Lake is productive in nature and subject to frequent winterkill. As a result, the Forest Service has installed a water circulator on the surface of this lake in an attempt to improve winter survival. Beaver is currently stocked on an annual basis with catchable-sized rainbow trout and may contain brook and cutthroat trout.

         DWR: Duck is an irregular natural lake situated in thick timber at the lower end of the East Fork Basin. It is 5.9 acres, 9,161 feet in elevation, with 5 feet maximum depth. The lake is a simple pothole located in a glacial catch-basin and there is no outlet. Access is 0.5 mile northeast of the East Fork Blacks Fork Road on an unmarked logging road through a small meadow to the river. Cross the river at this point and proceed east for 200 yards to the lake. Marginal camping areas are available with some horse feed. Spring water sources are unavailable. Duck is shallow with very little inflow, and the lake provides marginal fish habitat. However, experimental stocking has been scheduled for 1985 to fully evaluate the potential of this lake.

         DWR: This large scenic lake is situated immediately north and east of Little Lyman Lake in the West Fork Drainage (see directions to Little Lyman Lake). Lyman is 36.6 acres, 9,311 feet in elevation, with 30 feet maximum depth. A small dam has been placed across the outlet stream at Lyman to enlarge the original lake dimensions. Lyman is easily accessible and sustains heavy levels of fishing pressure. A summer youth camp has been established at the northeastern end of the lake. Good sites are available for primitive camping activity in the lake vicinity. However, a full service campground is maintained by the Forest Service at the nearby Little Lyman Lake with tap water and restroom facilities. Lyman has a history of winterkill and the fishery is sustained by periodic stockings of catchable-sized rainbow and albino rainbow trout. However, exprimental stocking of brook trout was accomplished during 1983 and 1984 to evaluate the winterkill situation at this water.

         DWR: Bridger is a productive sub-alpine water situated in timbered terrain with open shorelines in the lower Smiths Fork Basin. This natural lake is 21.0 acres, 9,350 feet in elevation, with 15-foot maximum depth. Bridger is located 25 miles south of Mountain View, Wyoming, on Highway 410 and improved Forest Service Roads. The route is well marked with signs. The Forest Service maintains a full service campground with 25 units at the lake and a summer guard station is located nearby. Bridger is a popular lake and receives substantial levels of fishing pressure. Shore fishing is difficult due to extensive beds of yellow pondlilly growing in shoal areas around much of the lake's perimeter. Bridger is most effectively fished with a small boat or inflatable raft. There are no launching facilities for larger boats. Bridger Lake receives periodic stocking of rainbow trout catchables throughout the summer, and annual plants of brook trout fingerling.

         DWR: China Reservoir is a scenic sub-alpine water situated in thick timber in the lower Smiths Fork Basin. It is 31.2 acres maximum, 9,408 feet in elevation, with 45-foot maximum depth. The lake has been enlarged by a dam at the northern end. Reservoir operation is capable of annual fluctuation of up to 9 feet and surface area reduction of about 39 percent. Access to China Lake is 1/8 mile north of the North Slope Road on foot following an old timber road which has been closed to vehicular access. This route begins at a small turnoff and parking area 1/2 mile west of China Meadows. Primitive camping is available with no sources of spring water. China Lake experiences moderate to heavy levels of angling pressure. This lake was previously managed to produce cutthroat trout, but is presently scheduled to receive annual stocking of brook trout supplemented by occasional plants of arctic grayling.

         DWR: Star is a reservoired lake located 1 mile northeast of Trial Lake. It is 16 acres maximum, 9,980 feet in elevation, with 35 feet maximum depth. Star is located in coniferous forest with scattered meadows to the north and northwest. There are few potential camping areas and no spring water. Horse feed is limited. From Trial Lake, follow the major inlet stream north to a small pond on a tributary. The reservoir is located at the top of this tributary stream. Star contains a limited population of cutthroat and brook trout and sustains heavy angling pressure. Star Lake contains a population of mountain suckers. It isn't known how these suckers got into the lake. One possibility is that they were brought in by anglers and used illegally as bait.

         DWR: Tail is a natural lake located south of Washington Reservoir in dense conifers. It is 9.8 acres, 9,980 feet in elevation, with 13 feet maximum depth. When Washington Reservoir is filled to capacity, there is a direct connection between the reservoir and Tail Lake. Access is ¼ mile southwest of the dam at Washington along the shoreline of the reservoir. There are several campsites but spring water is unavailable. Tail contains a good population of brook, cutthroat and rainbow trout. This lake isn't stocked. The fish either migrate from Washington Reservoir during high water or they are naturally produced. Angling pressure is heavy.

         DWR: Black Lake is a popular body of water located 15 miles from the Upper Stillwater Trailhead and 10.6 miles from Mirror Lake via Rocky Sea Pass. It is 11.8 acres, 10,403 feet in elevation, with 14 feet maximum depth. Well-marked access trails lead to the lake. Black Lake is often visited by Scout troops hiking the Highline Trail. An abundant population of brook trout is sustained by stocking and some natural reproduction. Some cutthroat trout are also present. Angling pressure is moderate to heavy. Campsites are plentiful in the general area, and springs are found along the west side of the lake. Horse feed may be found in open meadows 1/2 mile north of the lake. Black Lake is susceptible to overuse, especially during years when Rocky Sea Pass is snow-free most of the summer, allowing easier access from trailheads to the west.

         DWR: Of all the lakes in the High Uintas that are inaccessible by vehicle, Grandaddy Lake is probably the most popular. It is by far the largest natural lake in the Uintas, with 173 acres at 10,310 feet in elevation. Maximum depth is 40 feet. The lake is located 3.2 miles from the Grandview Trailhead and 13.4 miles from Mirror Lake. Campsites and horse feed are plentiful. A few springs are also located in the area. Grandaddy Lake is not stocked but nonetheless supports good numbers of brook and cutthroat trout sustained through natural reproduction. Fishing pressure is heavy, particularly during early summer. Keep in mind that, although the lake itself is open to year-round fishing, the tributaries to Grandaddy Lake are closed to fishing May 1 through mid-July. Check Fishing Proclamation for exact date, it may change slightly from year to year.

         DWR: Located at the end of the maintained trail into Weyman Lakes Basin, Lower Anson Lake is impossible to miss. Total distance from Spirit Lake and the Beaver Creek Trail head are 6.2 and 8.1 miles, respectively. The lake is 14.5 acres, 10,575 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 20 feet. Good campsites are infrequent in rough, rocky terrain. The best spots are in the vicinity of the trail. Horse feed is spotty. If you plan an extended trip, it is probably a good idea to pasture horses in the meadows along the stream between Lower and Upper Anson lakes. There is no spring water at Lower Anson, but there is a large spring on the east side of the creek about 0.1 mile north of Upper Anson Lake. Lower Anson Lake has been stocked in the past with brook trout. Due to apparent success of natural reproduction, stocking of brook trout was discontinued. Fishing pressure is moderate to heavy on this fairly popular water. A few cutthroat trout are also available.

         DWR: Upper Anson is a natural lake just 0.2 miles south of Lower Anson Lake in the Weyman Lakes Basin. A maintained Forest Service trail drops down from higher country to Lower Anson. From there a faint trail leads south along the east side of the creek to Upper Anson. Total distance from the Beaver Creek Trail head and Spirit Lake is 8.8 and 6.9 miles, respectively. Upper Anson Lake is 7.7 acres, 10,660 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 58 feet. Horses can travel within 100 yards of the lake but no further due to rocky terrain. There are no good campsites at the lake itself, however spring water is available. Campsites, horse feed and additional spring water are found between Upper and Lower Anson lakes. Upper Anson Lake contains a population of brook trout which sustains itself through natural reproduction. Fishing pressure is moderate.

         DWR: This small, shallow lake is located on the east side of Lamb Lakes Basin approximately 6.5 miles from Browne Lake. There is no maintained trail for the last 1.5 miles. The most direct access to lakes in this basin is cross-country from the junction of Forest Service trails 018-I and 017 southwest up the bottom of the basin. The going is rough through rocky timber and across boulder fields. Horse access is impossible by this route and should not be attempted. Supposedly, horses can get into Lamb Lakes Basin via two little-used trails, one which drops from the ridge southeast of Bummer Lake, the other which drops from the ridge northwest of Ewe Lake. The existence of these trails was not verified during this project. Horse use in Lamb Lakes Basin would be restricted due to the rocky terrain. Bummer Lake is 1.9 acres, 10,350 feet in elevation with a maximum depth of 6 feet. Wading can be an effective way to fish this lake. Use extreme caution, however, because footing is quite treacherous. The lake is periodically stocked with brook trout. Good campsites are rare, and there is no spring water. A little horse feed is found near the inlet. Fishing pressure is light.

Follow the directions to Hidden Lake (GR-7). Candy lies 0.2 miles north through rocky timber. Horses can be taken as far as Lower Anson Lake. Candy Lake sits at an elevation of 10,290 feet and has a maximum depth of 29 feet. Campsites are rare in the immediate vicinity, but spring water is present. The lake does not overwinter fish due to poor inlet flows, and stocking has been discontinued indefinitely. The lake may be experimentally planted sometime in the future with Arctic grayling which may prove more tolerant of the harsh environment. Check with the Division of Wildlife Resources Office in Vernal for the current management of this lake.

         DWR: This lake sits next to a steep bald mountain and has an earthen dam which allows water levels to fluctuate 7 feet. It is 38.3 acres, 10,894 feet in elevation, with 32 feet maximum depth. Access is gained by following the east inlet stream from Spider Lake southwest 1/4 mile to Bluebell. The last 1/4 mile is thick willows, pines and large boulders, so it is best to leave horses at Spider and walk into Bluebell. Campsites near the lake are sparse and very little horse feed is available. Brook trout are very abundant and a few cutthroat are also present; both species reproduce naturally. Fishing pressure is moderate.

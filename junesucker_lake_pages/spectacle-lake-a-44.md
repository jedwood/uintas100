# Spectacle Lake A-44

Spectacle Lake A-44 is located in Summit County, Utah. The lake lies within the Provo River drainage of Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest.

From Kamas take Mirror Lake Highway UT-150 for 17.8 miles. Just after the turn off for Duchesne Tunnel, you will take a left. This will put you onto Forest Road 041 also known as Spring Canyon Road. Follow this road for 4.5 miles. There is a small pond just off the fork to Blue Lake and Buckeye Lake. I recommend hiking in from here.

You can also access the lake via the Trial Lake turn off from the Mirror Lake Highway UT-150. From the Trial Lake turn off follow Forest Road 041 also known as Spring Canyon Road for 4.6 miles. You can park at the small pond just past Buckeye Lake.

I recommend hiking in from the pond near the fork in the road at the Buckeye and Blue Lake turn off. From just south of the pond head west for a quarter of a mile. I last did this hike in the fall of 2020 with with two small children and it was really easy. You should have no problem locating the lake.

There is a small turn off just south of the pond you can also enter from. The road will go back in a few hundred feet before breaking up into trees. On the map this looks like a shorter hike in, but it actually ends up being a bit longer.Â  Either way it's not a hard hike. The banks surrounding Spectacle Lake A-44 can be soft.

Typically stocked with Brook Trout on a 3 year cycle. 2020 stocked with 330 brook trout at 3.47 inches. 2018 stocked with 1,000 brook trout at 2.88 inches. 2015 stocked with 1008 brook trout at 2.5 inches.

# Ruth Lake

## Location:
Ruth Lake also known as BR-40 is located in Summit County and is part of the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. The parking area for Ruth Lake is located just off of the Mirror Lake Highway about three and a half miles on UT-150 after the Mirror Lake camp ground. There is signs on the road for the lake in both directions.

## The Hike:
There is two parking lots and the trail starts near the restrooms. The trail is marked by the DWR as moderate to difficult on the sign. I though the trail was pretty much as easy as it gets. There has been a lot of work done on the trail with rocks bridges built over the creeks and very little elevation gain. the distance is around 7 tenths of a mile.

## Fish Species:
Brook Trout

## Historical DWR Info:
10 acres, elevation 10,500 feet, maximum depth 31 feet, average depth 11 feet. By trail half mile west of the Hayden Peak turnout on the Mirror Lake Highway 150. A popular lake with campsites and horse feed near by. Good fishing for brook trout. Stocked regularly.
